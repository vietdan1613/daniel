## Background

As much as I enjoy creating DOM nodes and appending them to the `body`, that
seems like boilerplate that could live in an abstraction. And it is! Among other
things, that's what React Testing Library does.

Here's a simple example of how to use this:

```javascript
import {render, fireEvent, screen} from '@testing-library/react'

test('it works', () => {
  const {container} = render(<Example />)
  // container is the div that your component has been mounted onto.

  const input = container.querySelector('input')
  fireEvent.mouseEnter(input) // fires a mouseEnter event on the input

  screen.debug() // logs the current state of the DOM (with syntax highlighting!)
})
```

Testing Library also has a suite of assertions that can be installed with Jest.
They're already added to this project, so you can switch from Jest's built-in
assertions to more specific assertions which will give you better error
messages. So go ahead and swap the `expect(message.textContent).toBe(...)`
assertions with `toHaveTextContent` from
[`@testing-library/jest-dom`](http://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, fireEvent} from '@testing-library/react'
import Counter from '../../components/counter'

test('counter increments and decrements when the buttons are clicked', () => {
  const {container} = render(<Counter />)
  const [decrement, increment] = container.querySelectorAll('button')
  const message = container.firstChild.querySelector('div')

  expect(message).toHaveTextContent('Current count: 0')
  fireEvent.click(increment)
  expect(message).toHaveTextContent('Current count: 1')
  fireEvent.click(decrement)
  expect(message).toHaveTextContent('Current count: 0')
})
```
