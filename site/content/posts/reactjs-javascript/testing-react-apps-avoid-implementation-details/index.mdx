## Background

One of the most important things to remember about testing our software the way
it is used is to avoid testing implementation details. "Implementation details"
is a term referring to how an abstraction accomplishes a certain outcome. Thanks
to the expressiveness of code, you can typically accomplish the same outcome
using completely different implementation details

Here's one way you might access that `button` to click and assert on it:

```javascript
const {container} = render(<Counter />)
container.firstChild // <-- that's the button
```

What if we changed it a bit:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return (
    <span>
      <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
    </span>
  )
}
```

Our tests would break!

So here's a better way to search for that button in our test that's
implementation detail free and refactor friendly:

```javascript
render(<Counter />)
screen.getByText('0') // <-- that's the button
// or (even better) you can do this:
screen.getByRole('button', {name: '0'}) // <-- that's the button
```

As it turns out, clicking these buttons is also a bit of an implementation
detail. We're firing a single event, when we actually should be firing several
other events like the user does. When a user clicks a button, they first have to
move their mouse over the button which will fire some mouse events. They'll also
mouse down and mouse up on the input and focus it! Lots of events!

For this extra credit, swap out `fireEvent` for `userEvent` which you can get
like so:

```javascript
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
```

Full example

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import Counter from '../../components/counter'

test('counter increments and decrements when the buttons are clicked', async () => {
  render(<Counter />)
  const increment = screen.getByRole('button', {name: /increment/i})
  const decrement = screen.getByRole('button', {name: /decrement/i})
  const message = screen.getByText(/current count/i)

  expect(message).toHaveTextContent('Current count: 0')
  await userEvent.click(increment)
  expect(message).toHaveTextContent('Current count: 1')
  await userEvent.click(decrement)
  expect(message).toHaveTextContent('Current count: 0')
})
```
