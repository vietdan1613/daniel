## Background

### Authenticated HTTP requests

Applications without user authentication cannot reliably store and present data
tied to a specific user. And users expect the ability to save data, close the
app, and return to the app and interact with the same data they created. To do
this securely (in a way that doesn't allow anyone to access anyone else's data),
you need to support authentication. The most common approach to this is a
username/password pair.

However, the user doesn't want to submit their password every time they need to
make a request for data. They want to be able to log into the application and
then the application can continuously authenticate requests for them
automatically. That said, we don't want to store the user's password and send
that with every request. A common solution to this problem is to use a special
limited use "token" which represents the user's current session. That way the
token can be invalidated (in the case that it's lost or stolen) and the user
doesn't have to change their password. They simply re-authenticate and they can
get a fresh token.

So, every request the client makes must include this token to make authenticated
requests. This is one reason it's so nice to have a small wrapper around
`window.fetch`: so you can automatically include this token in every request
that's made. A common way to attach the token is to use a special request header
called "Authorization".

Here's an example of how to make an authenticated request:

```javascript
window.fetch('http://example.com/pets', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
})
```

That token can really be anything that uniquely identifies the user, but a
common standard is to use a JSON Web Token (JWT). ðŸ“œ https://jwt.io

Authentication and user identity management is a difficult problem, so it's
recommended to use a service to handle this for you. Most services will give you
a mechanism for retrieving a token when the user opens your application and you
can use that token to make authenticated requests to your backend. Some services
you might consider investigating are [Auth0](https://auth0.com/),
[Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/#enable-identity-in-the-ui),
and [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth).

Regardless of what service provider you use (or if you build your own), the
things you'll learn in this exercise are the same:

1. Call some API to retrieve a token
2. If there's a token, then send it along with the requests you make

```javascript
const token = await authProvider.getToken()
const headers = {
  Authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : undefined,
}
window.fetch('http://example.com/pets', {headers})
```

### Auth in React

In a React application you manage user authenticated state the same way you
manage any state: `useState` + `useEffect` (for making the request). When the
user provides a username and password, you make a request and if the request is
successful, you can then use that token to make additional authenticated
requests. Often, in addition to the token, the server will also respond with the
user's information which you can store in state and use it to display the user's
data.

The easiest way to manage displaying the right content to the user based on
whether they've logged in, is to split your app into two parts: Authenticated,
and Unauthenticated. Then you choose which to render based on whether you have
the user's information.

And when the app loads in the first place, you'll call your auth provider's API
to retrieve a token if the user is already logged in. If they are, then you can
show a loading screen while you request the user's data before rendering
anything else. If they aren't, then you know you can render the login screen
right away.
