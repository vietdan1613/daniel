## Background

We're going to start off as simple as possible, but it's still going to feel a
little different from anything you've probably done with async data loading
before, so buckle up.

Where the `data` and `promise` values are coming from all
depends on how you implement things .Imagine when your app loads, you need 
some data before you can show anything
useful. Typically we want to put the data loading requirements right in the
component that requires the data

```javascript
// ðŸš¨ This should NOT be copy/pasted for production code and is only here
// for experimentation purposes. The API for suspense (currently throwing a
// promise) is likely to change before suspense is officially released.
// This was strongly inspired by work done in the React Docs by Dan Abramov
function createResource(promise) {
  let status = 'pending'
  let result = promise.then(
    resolved => {
      status = 'success'
      result = resolved
    },
    rejected => {
      status = 'error'
      result = rejected
    },
  )
  return {
    read() {
      if (status === 'pending') throw result
      if (status === 'error') throw result
      if (status === 'success') return result
      throw new Error('This should be impossible')
    },
  }
}

function preloadImage(src) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    const img = document.createElement('img')
    img.src = src
    img.onload = () => resolve(src)
  })
}

export {createResource, preloadImage}
```

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {
  fetchPokemon,
  PokemonDataView,
  PokemonInfoFallback,
  PokemonErrorBoundary,
} from '../pokemon'
import {createResource} from '../utils'

let pokemonResource = createResource(fetchPokemon('pikachu'))

function PokemonInfo() {
  const pokemon = pokemonResource.read()
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="pokemon-info__img-wrapper">
        <img src={pokemon.image} alt={pokemon.name} />
      </div>
      <PokemonDataView pokemon={pokemon} />
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="pokemon-info-app">
      <div className="pokemon-info">
        <PokemonErrorBoundary>
          <React.Suspense fallback={<PokemonInfoFallback name="Pikachu" />}>
            <PokemonInfo />
          </React.Suspense>
        </PokemonErrorBoundary>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
