## Background

Sharing state between components is a common problem. The best solution for this
is to ðŸ“œ [lift your state](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html). This
requires ðŸ“œ [prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) which is
not a problem, but there are some times where prop drilling can cause a real
pain.

To avoid this pain, we can insert some state into a section of our react tree,
and then extract that state anywhere within that react tree without having to
explicitly pass it everywhere. This feature is called `context`. In some ways
it's like global variables, but it doesn't suffer from the same problems (and
maintainability nightmares)

Here's how you use context:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'

const FooContext = React.createContext()

function FooDisplay() {
  const foo = React.useContext(FooContext)
  return <div>Foo is: {foo}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <FooContext.Provider value="I am foo">
    <FooDisplay />
  </FooContext.Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
// renders <div>Foo is: I am foo</div>
```

## create a consumer hook

Imagine what would happen if someone tried to consume your context value without
using your context provider. For example, as mentioned above when discussing the
default value:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<FooDisplay />, document.getElementById('root'))
```

If you don't provide a default context value, that would render
`<div>Foo is: </div>`. This is because the context value would be `undefined`.
In real-world scenarios, having an unexpected `undefined` value can result in
errors that can be difficult to debug.

In this extra credit, you need to create a custom hook that I can use like this:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useCount()
```

And if you change the `App` to this:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CountDisplay />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Full example

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'

const CountContext = React.createContext()

function CountProvider(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const value = [count, setCount]
  return <CountContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
}

function useCount() {
  const context = React.useContext(CountContext)
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useCount must be used within a CountProvider')
  }
  return context
}

function CountDisplay() {
  const [count] = useCount()
  return <div>{`The current count is ${count}`}</div>
}

function Counter() {
  const [, setCount] = useCount()
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>Increment count</button>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CountProvider>
        <CountDisplay />
        <Counter />
      </CountProvider>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
