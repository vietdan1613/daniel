## Background

React's `useState` hook can get you a really long way with React state
management. That said, sometimes you want to separate the state logic from the
components that make the state changes. In addition, if you have multiple
elements of state that typically change together, then having an object that
contains those elements of state can be quite helpful.

This is where `useReducer` comes in really handy. If you're familiar with redux,
then you'll feel pretty comfortable here. If not, then you have less to unlearn

Here's an example of using `useReducer` to manage the value of a name in an
input.

```javascript
function nameReducer(previousName, newName) {
  return newName
}

const initialNameValue = 'Joe'

function NameInput() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useReducer(nameReducer, initialNameValue)
  const handleChange = event => setName(event.target.value)
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name: <input defaultValue={name} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <div>You typed: {name}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

One important thing to note here is that the reducer (called `nameReducer`
above) is called with two arguments:

1. the current state
2. whatever it is that the dispatch function (called `setName` above) is called
   with. This is often called an "action."

## accept the step as the action

```javascript
const countReducer = (count, change) => count + change

const [count, changeCount] = React.useReducer(countReducer, initialCount)
const increment = () => changeCount(step)
```

## simulate setState with an object

```javascript
const countReducer = (state, action) => ({ ...state, ...action })

const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount
})
const { count } = state
const increment = () => setState({ count: count + step })
```

## simulate setState with an object OR function

```javascript
const countReducer = (state, action) => ({
  ...state,
  ...(typeof action === 'function' ? action(state) : action)
})

const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
  count: initialCount
})
const { count } = state
const increment = () =>
  setState(currentState => ({ count: currentState.count + step }))
```

## traditional dispatch object with a type and switch statement

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'

function countReducer(state, action) {
  const { type, step } = action
  switch (type) {
    case 'increment': {
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count + step
      }
    }
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported action type: ${type}`)
    }
  }
}

function Counter({ initialCount = 0, step = 1 }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
    count: initialCount
  })
  const { count } = state
  const increment = () => dispatch({ type: 'increment', step })
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  return <Counter />
}

export default App
```
