## Background

Our users spend a lot of time interacting with forms and many of our forms are
among the most important parts of our application. Because of this, it's
pretty critical to have confidence that those continue to work over time.

You need to ensure that the user can find inputs in the form, fill in their
information, and validate that when they submit the form the submitted data is
correct.

Jest has built-in "mock" function APIs. Rather than creating the `submittedData`
variable. An important thing to keep in mind when testing is simplifying the maintenance
of the tests by reducing the amount of unrelated cruft in the test

- ðŸ“œ `jest.fn()`: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api
- ðŸ“œ `toHaveBeenCalledWith`:
  https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tohavebeencalledwitharg1-arg2-

There's a library I like to use for generating test data:
[`@jackfranklin/test-data-bot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jackfranklin/test-data-bot).

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import {build, fake} from '@jackfranklin/test-data-bot'
import Login from '../../components/login'

const buildLoginForm = build({
  fields: {
    username: fake(f => f.internet.userName()),
    password: fake(f => f.internet.password()),
  },
})

test('submitting the form calls onSubmit with username and password', async () => {
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)
  const {username, password} = buildLoginForm()

  await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/username/i), username)
  await userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), password)
  await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i}))

  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    username,
    password,
  })
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
})
```
