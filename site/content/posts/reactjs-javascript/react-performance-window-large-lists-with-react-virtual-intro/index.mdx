# Using 

It is a librarie using when render large lists

## Background

There's not much React can do if you simply need to make **huge**
updates to the DOM. In addition, our own code that runs during
the "render" phase may be fast, but if you have to do that tens of thousands of
times, you're going to have a hard time being fast on low-end devices.

Often you don't need to actually display tens of thousands
of list items, table cells, or data points to users. So if that content isn't
displayed, then you can kinda cheat by doing some "lazy" just-in-time rendering.

There are various libraries in the
React ecosystem for solving this problem. My personal favorite is called
`react-virtual`. Here's an example of how you would adapt a list to use
`react-virtual`'s `useVirtual` hook:

```javascript
// before
function MyListOfData({items}) {
  return (
    <ul style={{height: 300}}>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
// after
import {useVirtual} from 'react-virtual'

function MyListOfData({items}) {
  const listRef = React.useRef()
  const rowVirtualizer = useVirtual({
    size: items.length,
    parentRef: listRef,
    estimateSize: React.useCallback(() => 20, []),
    overscan: 10,
  })

  return (
    <ul ref={listRef} style={{position: 'relative', height: 300}}>
      <li style={{height: rowVirtualizer.totalSize}} />
      {rowVirtualizer.virtualItems.map(({index, size, start}) => {
        const item = items[index]
        return (
          <li
            key={item.id}
            style={{
              position: 'absolute',
              top: 0,
              left: 0,
              width: '100%',
              height: size,
              transform: `translateY(${start}px)`,
            }}
          >
            {item.name}
          </li>
        )
      })}
    </ul>
  )
}
```
