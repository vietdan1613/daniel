## Background

React is the most widely used frontend framework in the world and it's using the
same APIs that you're using when it creates DOM nodes.

One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms
(for example, native and web). Each of these platforms has its own code
necessary for interacting with that platform, and then there's shared code
between the platforms.

With that in mind, you need two JavaScript files to write React applications for
the web:

- React: responsible for creating React elements (kinda like
  `document.createElement()`)
- ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM (kinda like
  `rootElement.append()`)

Here's a simple example of the API:

```javascript
const elementProps = { id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!' }
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps)
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
```

Full example:

```javascript
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <script type="module">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
    const element = React.createElement('div', {
      className: 'container',
      children: [
        React.createElement('span', null, 'Hello'),
        ' ',
        React.createElement('span', null, 'World'),
      ],
    })
    ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)
  </script>
</body>
```
