- Database is just a bunch of files on disk.
- Storage Manager is the one that maintains the database files
- It organizes files as a collection of pages

## Pages

- A Page is a fixed-size block of data:
    - contains record (tuple), meta-data, indexes …
    - MySQL: 16KB (default size, can be configured)
    - SQL server, PostgreSQL: 8KB
- In a page, all records belong to the same table.
- When DBMS reads data, it reads by page.
- MySQL: max size of a row ~ ½ page’s size ~ 8KB (InnoDB engine)

### File Organization

- **Heap File Organization** is a common way DBMS organizes database files on disk
- Each file is an unordered collection of pages.
- A special page called **Directory page**: 
    - at the head of the file.
    - to keep track of the location of data pages in the file
    - to keep track of the number of free slots per page

### Directory Page

Mapping from Page_id to its position (offset) in the file. => increase read speed.

![example](./2.png 'example')

### Data Page

- Two parts: header, data
- Header contains metadata: Page Size, Checksum, DBMS version, Number of empty slot,...

![example](./3.png 'example')

### Page Layout

- Slotted page layout: Slot Array: at the beginning of the Page, right after the Header.
It maps “slots” to the tuple’s start position offsets.
- The tuples are at the end of the Page
- When insert a new tuple:
    - read the starting location of the last slot used.
    - create a new slot in slot array
    - write the new tuple to the position

## Buffer Pool (== Cache)

- A cache layer in memory (RAM). DBMS use Buffer Pool to improve the performance.
- A region in RAM, organized as an array of fixed-size pages. **Frame’s size** == **Page’s size**.
- The **page table** is a part of the Buffer Pool that map from the **page_id** to **frame_id**
- The **page directory** is part of the heap file that map from page_id to its location in the file.

![example](./5.png 'example')

### Buffer pool replacement policies

- The Buffer pool’s size is limited <= RAM’s size (80% RAM)
- DBMS needs to clear a frame to make room for a new page when it is full.
- Replacement policy is the way it decides which page to evict from the buffer pool. (Cache invalidation policy)
    - FIFO
    - LRU

## LRU (Least-Recently Used)

- For each page, maintain a timestamp of when it was last accessed.
- When need to evict a page, it selects the one with oldest timestamp.
- Assumption: if a page is accessed recently, it is likely that the page will be accessed again in near future.

```javascript
E.g: Size of B.P == 3
B.P: [ ] [ ] [ ]
read page 1 => [1] [ ] [ ]
read page 2 => [1] [2] [ ]
read page 3 => [1] [2] [3]
read page 4 => [4] [2] [3]
read page 1 => [4] [1] [3]
```

### disadvantage

Sequential flooding issue:
- when a query performs a sequential scan that reads every page.
- it pollutes the buffer pool with pages that are read once and then never again.

### LRU-K Idea

- use a hashmap to store the cache key-value
- use a doubly linked-list (DLL) to store the order each key is accessed.
- when a key is accessed:
    - if it is in the DLL, remove it then add to the end of DLL
    - if it is not in the DLL, and the size of the DLL is full, remove the first element of DLL, and add the 
    new key to the end of DLL. 

### Index

- A database index is a data structure that **improves the speed** of data retrieval operations on a 
database table 
- Types: Hash Indexes, B+Tree Indexes, SSTables Indexes
- Disadvantage: additional writes operation, storage space to maintain the index data structure

## Hash Indexes

- Based on a **Hash Table**
    - key: hash code of the indexed columns
    - value: pointer to the corresponding row (page_id, slot_id)
- Only **useful** for exact look-up. Cannot support range query, unequal condition ( >, <, >=, <=)
- Limitation:
    - **Performance** can be **unstable** in case of hash collision: search in hash table: O(n), average O(1)
    - Hash indexes **don’t support partial key matching**.
        - e.g: if you have index on (Col1, Col2), hash index won’t help if query on Col1 only or Col2 only.
        - select * from student where Col1 = 10; => full scan
        - select * from student where Col1 = 10 and Col2 = 20; => use hash indexes

## B+Tree Index

- The most common type of Index. Using B+Tree data structure.
- Performance is **stable** because B+Tree is a self-balanced tree.
- B+Tree of order M has the following properties:
    - Self-balanced: every **leaf node is at same depth**
    - Each node has **M-1 keys** and **M children**.
    - Every node (except root) is at least half-full: M/2-1 <= #keys <= M-1
    - Keys in each node are **sorted**.
    - Leaf nodes are **connected 2-ways** (looks like a Doubly Linked List)
- key is indexed column. Value can be pointer to the record (postgres) or the record’s data itself (clustered index of mysql)
- Each **leaf node** is corresponding to one Page. select *  where id = 10; => O(log #keys)

![example](./6.png 'example')

### Search 

- start from root, search correct child and follow the pointer. keys are sorted => can use Binary search
=> Runtime ~ O(logN)

### Why use B+Tree for index, not BST/AVL/Red-Black Tree

- B+trees are self-balancing while BST are not balancing => can lead to a very tall tree
- B+trees are much shorter than other balanced binary tree structures such as AVL => fewer disk access.
- If we want to retrieve a range of entries in order by key, B+trees is much more efficient than AVL, BST or 
Hash table, because each node contains a large number of key with sorted key.

### What is B+Tree indexes ’s disadvantage?

- more complex than Hash indexes
- write speed is slower than LMS-tree indexes (SSTable)
- for equality query (=, !=, IN), Hash Index is much faster. O(1) on average, B+Tree O(logN)

### Type of query that B+Tree indexes support:

- Match full value (same as hash index)
- Match leftmost prefix: index (Col1, Col2, Col3) => B+Tree index can support query on (Col1), or (Col1, Col2) 
or (Col1, Col2, Col3)
- Match part of the first column: index on Name column => B+Tree index can support query all records having 
Name start with letter “Qu”
- Match a range of values (>=, >, <= , <)

## B-Tree Index

- B-Tree is similar to B+Tree except:
    - inner node can contain pointer to records
    - no duplicated key in B-Tree
    - leaf-node are not connected as a Doubly Linked List

### B+Tree over B-Tree

- Support full scan: The leaf nodes of B+ trees are linked, so a full scan of all objects in a tree requires 
just one linear pass through all the leaf nodes.
- Inner node of B+Tree does not have a pointer to data => more keys can be packed in a B+Tree node => reducing 
the tree’s height.

## Indexes best practice

- Only index on isolating columns. should not be part of an expression or be inside a function in the query
> mysql> SELECT id FROM student WHERE **id + 1 = 5**;

- selectivity = number of distinct indexed values / number of rows in table. A highly selective index is good 
because it lets DBMS filter out more rows when it looks for matches. Trade-off:
> - more characters => higher selectivity, more space.
> - less characters => less selectivity, less space.

- Use Covering index: indexes that contain all the data needed to satisfy a query
> - CREATE INDEX idx_foo ON foo (a, b);
> - SELECT b FROM foo WHERE a = 123 AND b = 456;

## Transaction 

- a logical unit of processing in a DBMS that entails one or more database access operations.
- Purpose: to make sure data in database is consistent.
- Example: Alice transfer 100$ to Bob:

> - Subtract 100$ from Alice account
> - Add 100$ to Bob account
> - If there is no transaction, action 1 can be successful and action 2 fail => Alice lost 100$.

## ACID 

A set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity
- Atomicity: each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely. 
> q1 , q2 => execute q1 successfully, q2 failed => rollback q1 and return error.

- Consistency: data integrity constraints. 
> e.g., if we have a constraint, all customer accounts must have a positive balance. If a transaction brings a customer account into a negative balance, that transaction will be rolled back

- Isolation: 2 concurrent transactions are isolated from each other. Each transaction can pretend that it is the 
only transaction running on the entire DB. 
> - This highest isolation level is rarely used because of the performance expense.
> - mysql: default isolation level == repeatable read

- Durability: guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case 
of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash).

- What happens to index when database machine crashes? 
> DBMS use an additional data structure on disk called write-ahead log (WAL): 
> append-only file which every B+Tree index modification must be written before it can be applied
> append-only => fast
> When the database resumes after a crash, this log is used to restore B+Tree.
