**Change Data Capture** (CDC) is a technique used in **databases** to capture and **track changes** made to the data 
in **real-time**. It enables the detection and propagation of changes (inserts, updates, deletes) from the source 
system to other systems in an efficient and timely manner. CDC is commonly used in scenarios such as data 
replication, data warehousing, data integration, and synchronization between different databases or applications.

## Here's a simplified explanation of how CDC works:

- **Capture**: The first step involves capturing changes made to the data in the source database. This can be achieved 
through various methods such as database triggers, log-based capture, or using specialized CDC software.

- **Identify Changes**: Once changes are captured, CDC mechanisms identify what data has been modified, inserted, or 
deleted, as well as the specific rows affected by these changes.

- **Store Changes**: The identified changes are then stored in a dedicated location or log, often referred to as a 
CDC log or journal. This log typically contains metadata about the changes, such as the type of operation 
(insert, update, delete), the affected table, and the data before and after the change.

- **Propagate Changes**: Finally, the captured changes are propagated or applied to target systems or databases 
in near real-time. This ensures that the data in the target systems remains synchronized with the source data.

## CDC provides several benefits, including:

- **Real-time data synchronization**: Ensures that data across different systems remains up-to-date in near real-time.

- **Reduced latency**: Changes are propagated quickly, minimizing the delay between when a change occurs and when 
it is reflected in other systems.

- **Efficient data integration**: Allows for seamless integration of data from multiple sources without the need 
for bulk data transfers.

- **Minimal impact on performance**: CDC mechanisms are designed to capture changes with minimal overhead on the 
source database.

First of all, we also have source DB - where we track data changes. Kafka Connect plays the role of detecting 
changes and pushing events into Apache Kafka. Data can then be pushed to sinks depending on usage needs.
