## Step 1: Requirement clarification

Purpose: to solve the RIGHT problem!

- Functional requirements
    - What specific features are we going to build?
    - How many users daily does the product have?
    - Can I assume the read/write ratio is x:y? 100:1, 10:1
    - Does the system needs to be highly available, or do we focus on consistency? (CAP)
    - What is the required latency? => p99 <= 100ms

> Interview Question: **Design URL shortener**. (https://tinyurl.com/app)   
> Q: Can you tell me more about the **specific features** we need to support?     
> A: Given a URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias.     
> Q: How **short** the shortened link should be?      
> A: It is up to you.     
> Q: Does the shortened link have an **expiration time**?     
> A: Users can specify it.        
> Q: Can user **pick** their shortened URL?   
> A: Nope.    
> Q: Does URL need to be **random**?
> A: Yes, it should not be guessable
> Q: What are the non-functional requirements regarding availability, latency, and throughput?
> A: It should be real-time (low latency) and highly available. You can assume 500M new URLs per month.
> Q: What is the read: write ratio?
> A: read:write = 100:1

## Step 2: Estimation

- Purpose: estimate the scale of our system
    - Throughput (QPS)
    - Storage (Database, 10GB …)
    - Cache (RAM memory)

- We don't need to get the correct answer when estimating the system capacity, just a rough estimation.

> Example: URL shortener    
> 500M new URL / month => 200 url/s        
> Read/Write = 100:1    

## Step 3: Design API

```javascript
POST api/v1/shorten
request param: 
{ longURL: string}
response: {shortURL: string}

GET api/v1/{shortURL}
status code: 301 (redirect)
response: longURL
```

## Step 4: Database & Data model

### Database

- Choose between SQL and NoSQL. Draft the data model. (i.e define schema)

![example](./1.png 'example')

- How to choose?
    - If the system requires high consistency (e.g, banking system, order, wallet …) => SQL
    - If we can sacrifice consistency (i.e, data can be stale) and there is a lot of data => NoSQL
    - If data in system is independent => NoSQL (log, time series data (Stock price), URL shortener)
    - If you don't have a decent reason to choose NoSQL, go with SQL by default.

### Data model

![example](./2.png 'example')

## Step 5: High-level design and Deep dive

- Define the flow.
- Draw the high level design (draw.io)
- Choose the correct algorithms & data structures (e.g: QuadTree, Geohash, Consistent Hashing …)
- Deep dive into how to scale, eliminate SPoF 

### Flow: 

- Write flow: given a longURL => we use a hash function to get the shortURL => store to DB with expire date.
- Read flow: given a shortURL, we fetch from cache:
    > if cache hit, return longURL  
    > else query from DB    
    > if the URL is expired, return error.  
    > else write back to cache and return.  

![example](./3.png 'example')

**How to choose Hash Function?**
    > shortURL contains [a-z, A-Z, 0-9] ~ 62 characters.    
    > We need to store 60 billions URL for 10 years.        
    > => shortURL length should be 7 characters. Because 62^6 < 60B < 62^7      
    > We have few options here: (again, explain the tradeoff to interviewer)    
    > - Pick the first 7 characters of the hash => maybe leads to collision.
    > - Pick the first 7 characters and query the database to check collision. => high latency.
    > - Randomly pick 7 character from the hash

Other approaches:

    > Use encoding instead of hashing       
    > Generate an unique id integer for each longURL        
    > Convert to base62     
    > - Pros: no collision because the id is unique
    > - Cons: need to build a distributed ID generator, which is hard.

- Make it scalable and reliable.

    - Use multiple servers to serve the client => improve reliability, increase qps …
    - Use a Load Balancer to distribute the traffic: Round robin, Consistent Hashing …
    - Use a Cache to reduce the latency; 20/80 rule => cache only 20% of data.

## Prepare some common systems:

- Design ID generator
- Design rate limiter
- Design notification system
- Design order system
- Design Twitter news feed
- Design Proximity service (find nearby restaurants, drivers, atm, hotel …)
