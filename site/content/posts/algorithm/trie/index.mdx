- a data structure to manage a set of strings

- operations:
    - add(s): add string s to Trie
    - startWith(prefix): return true if there is a string in Trie has prefix as prefix.

- In a trie:
    - Each node represents a single character or part of a string.
    - The root represents an empty string or null character.
    - Each path from the root to a leaf node represents a string stored in the trie.
    - Nodes may have links to other nodes representing subsequent characters in the string.

- Space: O(total number of char of all words)
- Time: O(len(word)) for each operations (add, startWith, search)

> add(“tea”)    
> add(“ten”)    
> add(“to”)     
> add(“iin”)    
> startWith(“ii”) => true   
> startWith(“tem”) => false
