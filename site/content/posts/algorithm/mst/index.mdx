## Spanning Tree

- Given an undirected, weighted graph G(V, E)
- A spanning tree is a set of edges:
    - no cycle
    - connect all nodes of graph
- It is indeed a tree
- 1 graph can have multiple spanning trees

![example](./1.png 'example')

### Kruskal Algorithm

- sort the edges in ascending order
- consider each node as a separacted node in the beginning
- iterate each edge: (u, v, w)
    - if u and v is not in the same tree:
        - add (u,v) to the spanning tree
        - union(u,v)

Note: for undirected graph only
