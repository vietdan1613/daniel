## Dijkstra

Problem: given a weighted graph of non-negative weight, and a source node s, find shortest path from s to all 
other nodes.

![example](./1.png 'example')

- run time: O(nlogn+mlogn). Because m >> n => ~O(mlogn)
    - n is number of node
    - m is number of edge

- Space: O(n+m) for adjacent list, O(n) for heap => O(n+m)
