## What is garbage collection in C#?

Garbage collection (GC) in C# is an `automated memory management feature` provided by the .NET runtime 
(CLR - Common Language Runtime). It helps developers by automatically `reclaiming memory occupied by objects
that are no longer in use`, thus preventing memory leaks and optimizing the use of available memory.

**How Garbage Collection Works**

- **Allocation**: When a new object is created, it is `allocated on the managed heap in Generation 0`.
- **Triggering a GC**: GC can be triggered under several conditions, such as when Generation 0 is full or when system memory is low. It can also be explicitly triggered by the application, although this is generally discouraged.
- **Promotion**: Objects that survive a GC cycle are promoted to the next generation. Objects in Generation 0 that survive are promoted to Generation 1, and objects in Generation 1 that survive are promoted to Generation 2.
- **Collection**: During a garbage collection event, the GC will:
    - Suspend the execution of the application.
    - Identify all objects that are still reachable.
    - Reclaim memory from unreachable objects.
    - Compact the heap (if necessary) to reduce fragmentation.

**IDisposable and Dispose Pattern:**

The IDisposable interface and the Dispose method provide a way to `release unmanaged resources` deterministically. 
The using statement ensures that Dispose is called automatically.

```javascript
public class ResourceHolder : IDisposable
{
    private bool disposed = false;
    private IntPtr unmanagedResource; // Unmanaged resource

    public ResourceHolder()
    {
        // Allocate the unmanaged resource
        unmanagedResource = // allocation logic here
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Suppress finalization
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Dispose managed resources here
            }

            // Free unmanaged resources here
            if (unmanagedResource != IntPtr.Zero)
            {
                // Free the unmanaged resource
                unmanagedResource = IntPtr.Zero;
            }

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~ResourceHolder()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

## How does the using statement work in C#?

The using statement in C# is used to ensure that **IDisposable** objects are disposed of properly, 
`releasing any unmanaged resources they hold`. This is particularly useful for managing resources like 
`file handles, database connections, and network streams`.

```javascript
using (var resource = new SomeDisposableResource())
{
    // Use the resource
} // Dispose is called automatically here
```

## What are weak references?

Weak references in C# provide a way to reference an object without `preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming` 
the object's memory. They are useful for `caching` scenarios where you want to keep an object alive as long as it is 
being used but allow it to be collected when memory is needed. 

```javascript
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var strongReference = new MyClass();
        var weakReference = new WeakReference<MyClass>(strongReference);

        strongReference = null; // Remove strong reference

        MyClass retrievedObject;
        if (weakReference.TryGetTarget(out retrievedObject))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Object is still alive.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Object has been collected.");
        }
    }
}

class MyClass
{
    // Some class implementation
}
```

## What is the difference between Dispose and Finalize methods?

In C#, both **Dispose** and **Finalize** are methods used for `releasing unmanaged resources`, but they serve 
different purposes and have different usage patterns. Understanding the differences between them is crucial for 
effective resource management in your applications.

- The **Dispose** method is part of the `IDisposable interface` and is used to explicitly release unmanaged resources.
- The **Finalize** method (also known as a `destructor in C#`) is used to perform cleanup operations before the object 
is reclaimed by the garbage collector.

```javascript
public class ResourceHolder
{
    private IntPtr unmanagedResource; // Unmanaged resource

    public ResourceHolder()
    {
        // Allocate the unmanaged resource
        unmanagedResource = /* allocation logic here */;
    }

    ~ResourceHolder()
    {
        // Free the unmanaged resource
        if (unmanagedResource != IntPtr.Zero)
        {
            // Free the unmanaged resource
            unmanagedResource = IntPtr.Zero;
        }
    }
}
```

## Explain the concept of memory leaks and how to prevent them in C#.

Memory leaks in C# occur when `objects are not properly released, leading to increased memory` usage and potential 
application crashes. To prevent memory leaks, `implement the IDisposable interface and the dispose pattern`, 
use the using statement, unsubscribe from events, avoid static references, use weak references for caching, and 
ensure managed resources are disposed of correctly. Additionally, use tools like memory profilers and garbage 
collection logs to detect and diagnose memory leaks.

**Unmanaged Resources** Unmanaged resources are resources that are not handled by the .NET runtime and require explicit cleanup. Examples include:

- File Handles: Handles to open files provided by the operating system.
- Database Connections: Connections to databases managed by database engines (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle).
- Network Sockets: Network connections to other systems or services.
