## What are design patterns, and why are they important?

Design patterns are `reusable solutions to common problems in software design`. They provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios.

### Types of Design Patterns

1. **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.

- `Singleton`: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- `Factory Method`: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- `Abstract Factory`: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- `Builder`: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- `Prototype`: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between entities.

- `Adapter`: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- `Bridge`: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
- `Composite`: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- `Decorator`: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- `Facade`: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- `Flyweight`: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- `Proxy`: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- `Chain of Responsibility`: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
- `Command`: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- `Interpreter`: Implements a specialized language.
- `Iterator`: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
- `Mediator`: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- `Memento`: Captures and restores an object’s internal state.
- `Observer`: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- `State`: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- `Strategy`: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- `Template Method`: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- `Visitor`: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.

### Importance of Design Patterns

- `Standardization`: Provide a standard terminology and are well known in the software development community, `facilitating communication among developers`.
- `Reusability`: Offer `reusable solutions` that can be applied to common problems, saving time and effort in the development process.
- `Best Practices`: Incorporate the best practices and principles of object-oriented design, helping developers `create more robust and maintainable code`.
- `Improved Design`: Help in `designing systems that are more flexible, reusable, and easier to manage` and modify over time.
- `Documentation and Maintenance`: Serve as a guide for `documenting and understanding existing code`, which aids in maintaining and extending the system.

## Explain the Singleton pattern with an example.

The Singleton pattern ensures that `a class has only one instance` and `provides a global point of access to that instance`. 
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

The lock statement in C# is used to ensure that a block of code runs only by one thread at a time. It provides a mechanism for thread synchronization, 
which is essential in multi-threaded applications to avoid race conditions and ensure data integrity.

```javascript
using System;

public class Singleton
{
    // Private static variable that holds the single instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance = null;
    
    // Lock synchronization object
    private static readonly object padlock = new object();

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private Singleton()
    {
    }

    // Public static method to provide a global point of access to the instance
    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            // Double-check locking to ensure thread safety
            if (instance == null)
            {
                lock (padlock)
                {
                    if (instance == null)
                    {
                        instance = new Singleton();
                    }
                }
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }

    // Example method to demonstrate functionality
    public void ShowMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from the Singleton instance!");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Access the Singleton instance and call a method on it
        Singleton.Instance.ShowMessage();

        // Verify that only one instance is created
        Singleton s1 = Singleton.Instance;
        Singleton s2 = Singleton.Instance;

        if (s1 == s2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Both instances are the same.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Different instances.");
        }
    }
}
```

## What is the Repository pattern?

The Repository pattern is a design pattern that `mediates data access logic to business logic` by `encapsulating the set of objects stored` in a database and the 
operations performed over them. It provides a more object-oriented approach to accessing data and abstracts the details of data access, allowing the business 
logic to interact with a more meaningful domain model rather than directly with the database.

### Step 1: Define the Entity

```javascript
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

### Step 2: Define the Repository Interface

```javascript
using System.Collections.Generic;

public interface IProductRepository
{
    IEnumerable<Product> GetAll();
    Product GetById(int id);
    void Add(Product product);
    void Update(Product product);
    void Delete(int id);
}
```

### Step 3: Implement the Repository

```javascript
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly List<Product> _products = new List<Product>();

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll()
    {
        return _products;
    }

    public Product GetById(int id)
    {
        return _products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
    }

    public void Add(Product product)
    {
        _products.Add(product);
    }

    public void Update(Product product)
    {
        var existingProduct = _products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == product.Id);
        if (existingProduct != null)
        {
            existingProduct.Name = product.Name;
            existingProduct.Price = product.Price;
        }
    }

    public void Delete(int id)
    {
        var product = _products.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Id == id);
        if (product != null)
        {
            _products.Remove(product);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Use the Repository in Business Logic

```javascript
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IProductRepository productRepository = new ProductRepository();

        // Add some products
        productRepository.Add(new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Product 1", Price = 10.0m });
        productRepository.Add(new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Product 2", Price = 20.0m });

        // Retrieve and display all products
        var products = productRepository.GetAll();
        foreach (var product in products)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}");
        }

        // Update a product
        var productToUpdate = productRepository.GetById(1);
        if (productToUpdate != null)
        {
            productToUpdate.Name = "Updated Product 1";
            productToUpdate.Price = 15.0m;
            productRepository.Update(productToUpdate);
        }

        // Delete a product
        productRepository.Delete(2);

        // Retrieve and display all products again
        products = productRepository.GetAll();
        foreach (var product in products)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Id: {product.Id}, Name: {product.Name}, Price: {product.Price}");
        }
    }
}
```

## What are SOLID principles?

The SOLID principles are a `set of five design principles in object-oriented` programming that help developers create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. 

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Definition: A class `should have only one reason to change`, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
- Explanation: Each class should `focus on a single task or functionality`. This makes the class easier to maintain and test, as changes to one responsibility won't affect others.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Definition: Software entities (like classes, modules, functions, etc.) `should be open for extension but closed for modification.`
- Explanation: You should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing code`. This can be achieved through `inheritance, interfaces`, or other forms of polymorphism.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Explanation: If a `subclass is used in place of a superclass, the program should still behave correctly`. This ensures that derived classes extend the base class without changing its fundamental behavior.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Explanation: `Instead of having one large, complex interface, it's better to have multiple smaller, more specific interfaces`. This allows classes to implement only the methods they need, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- Explanation: This principle encourages the `decoupling of software components`. By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, the code becomes more flexible and easier to change or extend.

## How do you ensure code quality and maintainability in C# projects?

1. Adhere to SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle: Ensure each class or method has a single responsibility.
- Open/Closed Principle: Write code that can be extended without modifying existing code.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Ensure derived classes can be substituted for base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Break down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

2. Use Design Patterns

Implement design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, Repository, and Dependency Injection to solve common problems in a standardized way.
Design patterns help in writing code that is more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

3. Automated Testing

- Unit Testing: Write unit tests using frameworks like xUnit, NUnit, or MSTest to ensure individual components work as expected.
- Integration Testing: Test how different components work together.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Use CI tools like Azure DevOps, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions to run automated tests with each commit, ensuring new changes don’t break the existing code.

4. Follow Clean Code Practices

- Write readable and self-explanatory code by using meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes.
- Keep methods short and focused on a single task.
- Avoid magic numbers and hardcoded values; instead, use constants or configuration files.
- Properly document the code with comments and XML documentation where necessary.
