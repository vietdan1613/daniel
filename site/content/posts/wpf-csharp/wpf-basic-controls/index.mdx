## Command

Command line argument is a mechanism where a user can pass a set of parameters or 
values to a WPF application when it is executed. These arguments are very important to 
control an application from outside, for example, if you want to open a Word document 
from the command prompt, then you can use this command “C:\> start winword 
word1.docx” and it will open word1.docx document.

Command line arguments are handled in Startup function. Following is a simple example 
which shows how to pass command line arguments to a WPF application. Let’s create a 
new WPF application with the name WPFCommandLine.

## Custom Controls

A custom control is a class which offers its own style and template which are normally

extra property or an extra functionality to fit your specific scenario.

## User Control

User Controls provide a way to collect and combine different built-in controls together and 
package them into re-usable XAML. User controls are used in following scenarios:

- If the control consists of existing controls, i.e., you can create a single control of 
multiple, already existing controls.

- If the control doesn't need support for theming. User Controls do not support 
complex customization, control templates, and difficult to style.

- If a developer prefers to write controls using the code-behind model where a view 
and then a direct code behind for event handlers.

- You won't be sharing your control across applications.
