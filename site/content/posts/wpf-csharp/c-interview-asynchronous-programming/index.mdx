## What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important?

Asynchronous programming in C# allows tasks to `run concurrently without blocking the main thread`, making applications 
more responsive and efficient. This is particularly useful for operations that involve waiting, such as I/O operations 
(file access, database queries, web requests), where blocking the main thread would lead to poor performance and a poor 
user experience.

### Importance of Asynchronous Programming:

- **Improved Performance**: Asynchronous programming `allows your application to handle multiple tasks concurrentl`y. 
For example, a web server can handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for each request to complete 
before starting the next one.
- **Enhanced Responsiveness**: In user-facing applications, such as desktop or mobile apps, asynchronous 
programming ensures that the `user interface remains responsive while performing long-running operations in the background`.

```javascript
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting file read...");

        // Start the file read operation
        string content = await ReadFileAsync("file.txt");

        // This will run before the file reading is completed
        Console.WriteLine("This will run before the file reading is completed.");

        // Print the file content
        Console.WriteLine(content);
    }

    static async Task<string> ReadFileAsync(string filePath)
    {
        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
        {
            // Read the file content asynchronously
            string content = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
            return content;
        }
    }
}
```

## Explain the async and await keywords in C#.

The async and await keywords in C# are used to facilitate asynchronous programming, allowing you to write 
asynchronous code that is easy to read and maintain. These `keywords enable you to execute tasks without blocking the main thread`, 
improving the responsiveness and performance of your applications.

## What is a Task in C#?

The **async** keyword is used to `declare a method as asynchronous`. The **await** keyword is used to 
`pause the executio`n of an asynchronous method until the awaited task completes

- An async method can `return Task or void`. Returning void is typically reserved for event handlers.

```javascript
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting file read...");

        // Start the file read operation asynchronously
        string content = await ReadFileAsync("file.txt");

        // This will run after the file reading is completed
        Console.WriteLine("File reading completed.");
        Console.WriteLine(content);
    }

    static async Task<string> ReadFileAsync(string filePath)
    {
        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
        {
            // Read the file content asynchronously
            string content = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
            return content;
        }
    }
}
```

## How do you handle exceptions in asynchronous methods?

You can use try-catch blocks in asynchronous methods just like in synchronous methods. When an awaited task throws an 
exception, it is captured and can be handled within the try-catch block.

```javascript
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            string content = await ReadFileAsync("file.txt");
            Console.WriteLine(content);
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"File not found: {ex.Message}");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    static async Task<string> ReadFileAsync(string filePath)
    {
        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
        {
            return await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

## What is the difference between Task.Run and Task.Factory.StartNew?   

**Task.Run** and **Task.Factory.StartNew** are both used to create and start tasks in C#, but they have 
`different default behaviors` and use cases. Understanding these differences is important to choose the right 
method for your specific scenario.

- **Task.Factory.StartNew** is a `lower-level method` that offers more control over task creation and scheduling. 
It provides a wide `range of options through its parameters`, which can be useful in advanced scenarios.
- When you `need more control over task creation`, such as specifying a custom task scheduler, 
setting task creation options, or passing a cancellation token.

```javascript
Task task = Task.Run(() => {
    // Perform some CPU-bound work here
    Console.WriteLine("Running on a background thread.");
});

Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
    // Your code here
}, 
TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);  // Example of specifying a TaskCreationOption
```
