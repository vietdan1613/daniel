## What is data binding in WPF?

Data binding in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a mechanism that `connects a user interface (UI) to a data source`. 
This allows for the `automatic synchronization` of data between the UI and the underlying data model. In WPF, data binding 
enables developers to define a binding between a UI control and a property or a collection in the data model, making it 
easier to display and interact with data.

### Key Concepts of Data Binding in WPF

- `Binding Source`: The object that contains the data. This could be a simple object, a collection of objects, or a more 
complex data model.

- `Binding Target`: The UI element that displays the data. This could be a control like a TextBox, ListBox, or DataGrid.

- `Binding Mode`:

    - OneWay: Data flows from the source to the target.
    - TwoWay: Data flows both ways, allowing changes in the UI to update the source and vice versa.
    - OneWayToSource: Data flows from the target to the source.
    - OneTime: Data is set when the binding is created, and changes are not tracked.
    - Binding Path: Specifies the path to the data property on the binding source.

- `DataContext`: The context in which the data binding occurs. It is typically set at the window or control level and determines 
the default source for all data bindings within that context.

- `INotifyPropertyChanged Interface`: Used to notify the binding system that a property value has changed. Implementing this 
interface in your data model ensures that changes in the model are automatically reflected in the UI.

- `ObservableCollection`: A collection that provides notifications when items are added, removed, or when the entire list is 
refreshed. It is commonly used as a binding source for collections in the UI.

## Explain the different types of data binding in WPF.

In WPF, data binding allows you to connect UI elements to data sources, facilitating a dynamic and interactive user interface. 
There are several types of data binding modes, each serving different needs depending on how data should flow between the 
source and target. Here are the different types of data binding in WPF:

### 1. OneWay Binding

OneWay binding `updates the target property when the source property changes`. However, `changes in the target property do not affect the source property`. 
This mode is useful when you need to display data that doesn't need to be edited by the user.

### 2. TwoWay Binding

TwoWay binding `updates both the target and source properties`. When the source property changes, the target property is updated, 
and vice versa. This mode is ideal for editable forms where user input needs to be reflected in the data model.

### 3. OneWayToSource Binding

OneWayToSource binding is the `reverse of OneWay binding`. It updates the source property when the target property changes but 
not the other way around. This mode can be useful when you need to `capture user input without reflecting changes back to the UI`.

### 4. OneTime Binding

OneTime binding updates the target property `only when the binding is first established`. This means that any subsequent changes
to the source property will not affect the target property. OneTime binding is suitable for displaying static data that does not 
change during the lifetime of the application.

### 5. Default Binding

The default binding mode depends on the dependency property being bound. For instance, most read/write properties default 
to `TwoWay binding`, while read-only properties default to OneWay binding. If no mode is explicitly set, the default mode of 
the property is used.

```xaml
<Label Content="{Binding Path=Title, Mode=OneWay}" />
<TextBox Text="{Binding Path=Description, Mode=TwoWay}" />
<TextBox Text="{Binding Path=UserInput, Mode=OneWayToSource}" />
<TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=CreatedDate, Mode=OneTime}" />
```
