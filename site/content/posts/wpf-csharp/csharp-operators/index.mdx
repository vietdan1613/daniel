An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or 
logical manipulations. C# has rich set of built-in operators and provides the following 
type of operators:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Misc Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator               | Description             | Example                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| +               | Adds two operands    | A + B = 30    |
| -              | Subtracts second operand from the first    | A - B = -10    |
| *              | Multiplies both operands    | A * B = 200 |
| / | Divides numerator by de-numerator | B / A = 2| 
| % | Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B % A = 0| 
| ++ | Increment operator increases integer value by one | A++ = 11| 
| -- | Decrement operator decreases integer value by one | A-- = 9| 

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 21;
            int b = 10;
            int c;
            c = a + b;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 1 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a - b;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 2 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a * b;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 3 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a / b;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 4 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a % b;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 5 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a++;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 6 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a--;
            Console.WriteLine("Line 7 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            Console.ReadLine();
            //Line 1 - Value of c is 31
            //Line 2 - Value of c is 11
            //Line 3 - Value of c is 210
            //Line 4 - Value of c is 2
            //Line 5 - Value of c is 1
            //Line 6 - Value of c is 21
            //Line 7 - Value of c is 22
        }
    }
}
```

## Relational Operators

| Operator               | Description             | Example                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| == | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. | (A == B) is not true.| 
| != | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. | (A != B) is true.| 
| > | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.| (A > B) is not true.| 
| < | Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.| (A < B) is true.| 
| >= | Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.| (A >= B) is not true.| 
| <= | Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.| (A <= B) is true.| 

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 21;
            int b = 10;

            if (a == b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 1 - a is equal to b");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 1 - a is not equal to b");
            }
            if (a < b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 2 - a is less than b");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 2 - a is not less than b");
            }
            if (a > b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 3 - a is greater than b");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 3 - a is not greater than b");
            }
            /* Lets change value of a and b */
            a = 5;
            b = 20;
            if (a <= b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to b");
            }
            if (b >= a)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 5-b is either greater than or equal to b");
            }
            //Line 1 - a is not equal to b
            //Line 2 - a is not less than b
            //Line 3 - a is greater than b
            //Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to b
            //Line 5 - b is either greater than or equal to b
        }
    }
}
```

## Logical Operators

| Operator               | Description             | Example                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true.| (A && B) is false.| 
| \|\| | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true.| (A \|\| B) is true.| 
| ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.| !(A && B) is true.| 

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            bool a = true;
            bool b = true;
            if (a && b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 1 - Condition is true");
            }
            if (a || b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 2 - Condition is true");
            }
            /* lets change the value of a and b */
            a = false;
            b = true;
            if (a && b)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 3 - Condition is true");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 3 - Condition is not true");
            }
            if (!(a && b))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Line 4 - Condition is true");
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
            //Line 1 - Condition is true
            //Line 2 - Condition is true
            //Line 3 - Condition is not true
            //Line 4 - Condition is true
        }
    }
}
```

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation. The truth tables for 
&, |, and ^ are as follows

| p | q | p & q | p \| q | p ^ q | 
|---|---|-------|---|---|-------| 
| 0|  0|  0|  0|  0| 
| 0|  1|  0|  1|  1| 
| 1|  1|  1|  1|  0| 
| 1|  0|  0|  1|  1| 

Assume if A = 60; and B = 13, then in the binary format they are as follows:
> A = 0011 1100     
> B = 0000 1101     
> -----------------     
> A&B = 0000 1100       
> A|B = 0011 1101   
> A^B = 0011 0001   
> ~A = 1100 0011    

The Bitwise operators supported by C# are listed in the following table. Assume 
variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13, then

| Operator               | Description             | Example                                                               |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| & | Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.| (A & B) = 12,which is 0000 1100| 
| \| | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.| (A \| B) = 61, which is 0011 1101| 
| ^ | Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.| (A ^ B) = 49, which is 0011 0001| 
| ~ | Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.| (~A ) = 61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement due to a signed binary number.| 
| << | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.| A << 2 = 240, which is 1111 0000| 
| >> | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.| A >> 2 = 15, which is 0000 1111| 

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 60; /* 60 = 0011 1100 */
            int b = 13; /* 13 = 0000 1101 */
            int c = 0;
            c = a & b; /* 12 = 0000 1100 */
            Console.WriteLine("Line 1 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a | b; /* 61 = 0011 1101 */
            Console.WriteLine("Line 2 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a ^ b; /* 49 = 0011 0001 */
            Console.WriteLine("Line 3 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = ~a; /*-61 = 1100 0011 */
            Console.WriteLine("Line 4 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a << 2; /* 240 = 1111 0000 */
            Console.WriteLine("Line 5 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            c = a >> 2; /* 15 = 0000 1111 */
            Console.WriteLine("Line 6 - Value of c is {0}", c);
            Console.ReadLine();
            //Line 1 - Value of c is 12
            //Line 2 - Value of c is 61
            //Line 3 - Value of c is 49
            //Line 4 - Value of c is -61
            //Line 5 - Value of c is 240
            //Line 6 - Value of c is 15
        }
    }
}
