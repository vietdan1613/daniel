## Explain the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming.

1. `Encapsulation`

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) that `operate on the data 
into a single unit called a class`. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which 
can prevent the accidental modification of data. Encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers:

- `private`: The members are accessible only within the class.
- `protected`: The members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.
- `public`: The members are accessible from outside the class.

2. `Abstraction`

Abstraction is the concept of `hiding the complex implementation details` and `showing only the 
essential features of the object`. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. 
Abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

3. `Inheritance`

Inheritance in C# is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming that allows one class 
(the derived or child class) to `inherit the fields, properties, methods, and events of another class` 
(the base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchical 
relationship between classes.

4. `Polymorphism`

Polymorphism in C# is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of 
different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a `single interface 
to represent different underlying data types`, allowing methods to be used interchangeably with 
different implementations. There are two main types of polymorphism in C#: compile-time (static) 
polymorphism and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.. Polymorphism is typically achieved through 
`method overriding and method overloading`.

## What is inheritance in C#?

- Use the colon `:` symbol to denote inheritance.
- Members declared as `protected` in the base class are accessible within the derived class but not from outside.
- The `base` keyword is used to call a method or constructor in the base class from the derived class.
- The derived class can override base class methods using the `override` keyword, provided the base class m
ethod is marked with the `virtual` keyword.
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated and can contain `abstract methods` (methods without implementation) 
that must be implemented in derived classes.
- Benefits of Inheritance:
    - `Code Reusability`: Common code can be placed in a base class and reused in derived classes.
    - `Polymorphism`: Derived classes can provide specific implementations of base class methods.
    - `Maintenance`: Easier to manage and update the code when changes are required.

```javascript
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Eating");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Barking");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.Eat(); // Inherited method
        dog.Bark(); // Method of Dog class
    }
}
```

## What is polymorphism in C#?

- `Method Overloading`: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different signatures (parameters).

```javascript
public class MathOperations
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
        Console.WriteLine(math.Add(1, 2));        // Calls int Add(int, int)
        Console.WriteLine(math.Add(1.5, 2.5));    // Calls double Add(double, double)
    }
}
```

- `Method Overriding`: A derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already 
defined in its base class. The base class method must be marked with the virtual keyword, and the 
derived class method must use the override keyword.

```javascript
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal sound");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.MakeSound();  // Outputs: Bark
    }
}
```

- `Benefits` of Polymorphism
    - `Flexibility` and Maintainability: It allows the code to be more flexible and easier to maintain.
    - Code `Reusability`: Methods written for base classes or interfaces can work with any derived class or implementing class.
    - `Extensibility`: New classes can be added with little or no modification to existing code.

## What is an interface, and how is it different from an abstract class?

An interface is a contract that `defines a set of methods` and properties that implementing classes must 
provide. It can be implemented by any class or struct, which then must provide the concrete implementations 
of the interface's members.

- Implementation: A `class or struct that implements the interface must implement all its members`.
- Multiple Inheritance: A class or struct `can implement multiple interfaces`.
- No Implementation: Interfaces `cannot contain any implementation`; all methods and properties are abstract by default.

```javascript
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw();
    double Area();
}

public class Circle : IShape
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing Circle");
    }

    public double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    private double radius;
    public Circle(double radius) => this.radius = radius;
}
```

### Abstract Class

- Abstract Class: Can provide `both complete and incomplete implementations`.
- Abstract Class: A class can inherit from `only one abstract class`. Interface: A class can implement `multiple interfaces`.
- Abstract Class: `Members can have access modifiers` (private, protected, public, etc.). Interface: Members are `public by default`

```javascript
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Draw();
    public abstract double Area();

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Displaying shape");
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double radius) => this.radius = radius;

    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing Circle");
    }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

## Explain the concept of encapsulation with an example.

Encapsulation in C# is a key principle of object-oriented programming that involves wrapping 
data (`fields`) and methods (`functions`) that operate on the data `into a single unit, usually a class`, and 
restricting access to some of the object's components. This ensures that the internal representation 
of the object is hidden from the outside. The data is accessed and modified through public methods, often 
referred to as getters and setters.

```javascript
using System;

public class BankAccount
{
    // Private fields
    private string accountNumber;
    private decimal balance;

    // Constructor to initialize the account
    public BankAccount(string accountNumber, decimal initialBalance)
    {
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            balance += amount;
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Deposit amount must be positive.");
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw money
    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance)
        {
            balance -= amount;
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Insufficient funds or invalid amount.");
        }
    }

    // Public method to get the current balance
    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }
}

// Usage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a new bank account
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("123456", 1000m);
        
        // Deposit money into the account
        account.Deposit(500m);
        
        // Withdraw money from the account
        account.Withdraw(200m);
        
        // Print the current balance
        Console.WriteLine("Current Balance: " + account.GetBalance());  // Outputs: Current Balance: 1300
    }
}
```
