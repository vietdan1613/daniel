## What is reflection in C#?

Reflection in C# is a `feature that allows a program to inspect and interact with its own metadata at runtime`. 
This includes the ability to:

- **Creating plugins or extensibility frameworks**: Where `types are loaded at runtime`.
- **Developing object serializers**: Where types are examined to `generate XML or JSON`.
- **Unit testing frameworks**: Which `discover and invoke tests based on reflection`.

```javascript
using System;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Text;

public class SimpleJsonSerializer
{
    public static string SerializeObject(object obj)
    {
        Type type = obj.GetType();
        StringBuilder jsonBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        jsonBuilder.Append("{");

        PropertyInfo[] properties = type.GetProperties();
        for (int i = 0; i < properties.Length; i++)
        {
            PropertyInfo property = properties[i];
            string name = property.Name;
            object value = property.GetValue(obj, null);

            jsonBuilder.AppendFormat("\"{0}\": \"{1}\"", name, value);

            if (i < properties.Length - 1)
            {
                jsonBuilder.Append(", ");
            }
        }

        jsonBuilder.Append("}");
        return jsonBuilder.ToString();
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Person person = new Person
        {
            FirstName = "John",
            LastName = "Doe",
            Age = 30
        };

        string json = SimpleJsonSerializer.SerializeObject(person);
        Console.WriteLine(json);
    }
}
```

## Explain the concept of extension methods.

Extension methods in C# allow you to `add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code` or creating 
a new derived type. This is particularly useful when you want to add functionality to classes that you don’t control, such 
as classes from the .NET Framework or third-party libraries.

Many of the **LINQ** methods, like** Where, Select, OrderBy**, etc., are implemented as extension methods for IEnumerable.
This allows you to use LINQ queries on any collection that implements IEnumerable.

```javascript
using System;

public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static int WordCount(this string str)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(str))
            return 0;

        string[] words = str.Split(new char[] { ' ', '\t', '\n' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
        return words.Length;
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        string sentence = "Hello world, this is an example sentence.";
        int count = sentence.WordCount();  // Using the extension method
        Console.WriteLine($"Word count: {count}");
    }
}
```

## What is the difference between const and readonly?

In C#, const and readonly are both used to define fields that are `intended to remain constant after their initial` 
assignment. However, they differ in several key aspects:

### const:

- Must be `initialized at the time of declaration`.
- `Implicitly static`, meaning it belongs to the type itself rather than an instance.
- Can only be used with primitive types (like `int, char, float`, etc.), enums, or strings, or null for reference types.

### readonly:

- Can be initialized either at the time of declaration or in a constructor.
- Can be instance-level (non-static) or static.
- Can be used with any data type, including complex objects and arrays.

```javascript
public class Example
{
    public const int ConstValue = 10; // Known at compile time, can't change

    public readonly int ReadOnlyValue;

    public Example(int value)
    {
        ReadOnlyValue = value; // Can be set differently depending on how the constructor is called
    }
}
```

## What is the purpose of the var keyword?

The var keyword in C# is used for `implicitly typed local variables`. It allows the compiler to automatically 
determine the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it at the time of declaration. This can make 
code cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with complex types or when the exact type is evident 
from the context.

### Limitations:

- Explicit Initialization: You `must initialize a var variable at the point of declaration`; otherwise, the compiler won't be able to infer the type.
- Readability: Overuse of var can make the code `less readable`, especially when the inferred type is not immediately obvious. For example, it's better to use explicit typing when the type is not clear from the context.

```javascript
var number = 10;       // int
var name = "John";     // string
var list = new List<int>();  // List<int>
```

## How do you serialize and deserialize objects in C#?

In C#, serialization is the process of `converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted` 
(e.g., to a file, a database, or over a network). Deserialization is the reverse process—converting the serialized 
data back into an object. C# provides several ways to serialize and deserialize objects, with the most common methods 
involving JSON, XML, and binary formats.

### 1. Serialization with JSON

The System.Text.Json and Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET) libraries are commonly used for JSON serialization.

Using System.Text.Json (built-in in .NET Core and later):

```javascript
using System;
using System.Text.Json;

public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Person person = new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 };
        
        // Serialize to JSON
        string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);
        Console.WriteLine(jsonString);

        // Deserialize from JSON
        Person deserializedPerson = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Person>(jsonString);
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {deserializedPerson.Name}, Age: {deserializedPerson.Age}");
    }
}
```

### 2. Serialization with XML

The System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer class is used for XML serialization.

```javascript
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml.Serialization;

public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Person person = new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 };

        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Person));
        using (StringWriter writer = new StringWriter())
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, person);
            string xmlString = writer.ToString();
            Console.WriteLine(xmlString);
        }

        using (StringReader reader = new StringReader(xmlString))
        {
            Person deserializedPerson = (Person)serializer.Deserialize(reader);
            Console.WriteLine($"Name: {deserializedPerson.Name}, Age: {deserializedPerson.Age}");
        }
    }
}
```
