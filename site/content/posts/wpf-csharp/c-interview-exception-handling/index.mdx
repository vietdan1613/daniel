## How do you handle exceptions in C#?

Handling exceptions in C# involves using a combination of `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` statements. 
Here's a breakdown of these components:

```javascript
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            // Code that might throw an exception
            int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };
            Console.WriteLine(numbers[5]); // This will throw an IndexOutOfRangeException

            using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("nonexistentfile.txt"))
            {
                // This will throw a FileNotFoundException
                Console.WriteLine(sr.ReadToEnd());
            }
        }
        catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An index was out of range: " + ex.Message);
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File not found: " + ex.Message);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred: " + ex.Message);
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Execution of the try-catch block is complete.");
        }
    }
}
```

## What is the difference between throw and throw ex in C#?

In C#, both `throw` and `throw ex` are used to raise exceptions, but they 
`differ in how they affect the stack trace information`, which is crucial for debugging.

- **throw**: Re-throws the `current exception` while preserving the original stack trace information.

- **throw ex**: Throws the `caught exception but resets the stack trace` to the current location. Making it harder 
to trace the source of the exception, `only use throw ex if you have a specific reason`.


```javascript
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            Method1();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Caught in Main: " + ex.StackTrace);
        }
    }

    static void Method1()
    {
        try
        {
            Method2();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Caught in Method1");
            // throw ex; // Uncomment this to see the difference
            throw; // Preserve original stack trace
        }
    }

    static void Method2()
    {
        throw new Exception("An error occurred in Method2");
    }
}

// Output with throw:

// Caught in Method1
// Caught in Main:    at Program.Method2() in ...\Program.cs:line 26
//    at Program.Method1() in ...\Program.cs:line 19
//    at Program.Main() in ...\Program.cs:line 10

// Output with throw ex:

// Caught in Method1
// Caught in Main:    at Program.Method1() in ...\Program.cs:line 20
//    at Program.Main() in ...\Program.cs:line 10
```

## What is a finally block?

A finally block in C# is a section of code that is `guaranteed to execute regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not`. 
It is typically `used for cleanup operations, such as releasing resources, closing file streams`, or resetting variables, 
ensuring that these operations occur even if an error occurs in the try block.


```javascript
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        StreamReader reader = null;
        try
        {
            reader = new StreamReader("example.txt");
            Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());
        }
        catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("File not found: " + ex.Message);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
        }
        finally
        {
            if (reader != null)
            {
                reader.Close();
                Console.WriteLine("File stream closed.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## What are custom exceptions in C#?

Custom exceptions in C# are `user-defined exception classes that extend the base Exception class`. They are used to 
create meaningful and specific error conditions that are relevant to the application or domain. Custom exceptions can i
mprove the readability and maintainability of your code by providing more context about what went wrong, compared to 
using generic exceptions.


```javascript
using System;

public class InvalidAgeException : Exception
{
    public int Age { get; }

    public InvalidAgeException() { }

    public InvalidAgeException(string message) : base(message) { }

    public InvalidAgeException(string message, int age) : base(message)
    {
        Age = age;
    }

    public InvalidAgeException(string message, Exception inner) : base(message, inner) { }
}
```


```javascript
public class Person
{
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void SetAge(int age)
    {
        if (age < 0 || age > 150)
        {
            throw new InvalidAgeException($"Invalid age: {age}", age);
        }

        Age = age;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Person person = new Person();
        try
        {
            person.SetAge(-5);
        }
        catch (InvalidAgeException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught an InvalidAgeException: {ex.Message}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Invalid age provided: {ex.Age}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Explain the concept of exception filtering in C#.

Exception filtering in C# `allows you to conditionally catch exceptions based on a predicate`. This is done using the 
`when keyword` in the catch block. The when clause specifies a condition that must be true for the exception to be caught. 
This feature provides more granular control over exception handling by enabling you to catch exceptions only when 
certain conditions are met.

- `Reduces the overhead of handling exception`s that do not meet specific criteria by avoiding unnecessary catch block executions.
- If an exception is not caught by a catch block with a when filter (because the condition evaluated to false), it will `propagate to the next matching catch` block or up the call stack.

```javascript
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        try
        {
            ThrowException();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex is InvalidOperationException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Caught an InvalidOperationException.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex.Message.Contains("special"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Caught an exception with a special message.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught a general exception: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    static void ThrowException()
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("This is a special invalid operation.");
    }
}
```
