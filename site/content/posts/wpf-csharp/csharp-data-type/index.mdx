The variables in C#, are categorized into the following types:

- Value types
- Reference types
- Pointer types

## Value types

Value type variables can be assigned a value directly. They are derived from the class
System.ValueType.

The value types directly contain data. Some examples are int, char, and float, which 
stores numbers, alphabets, and floating point numbers, respectively. When you 
declare an int type, the system allocates memory to store the value.

| Type               | Represents               | Range               | Default Value               |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| bool          | Boolean value    | True or False    | False    |
| byte          | 8-bit unsigned integer    | 0 to 255     | 0    |
| char          | 16-bit Unicode character    | U +0000 to U +ffff    | '\0'    |
| decimal          | 128-bit precise decimal values with 28-29 significant digits    | (-7.9 x 10^28 to 7.9 x 10^28) / 100 to ^28    | 0.0M    |
| double          | 64-bit double-precision floating point type    | (+/-)5.0 x 10^-324 to (+/-)1.7 x 10^38    | 0.0D    |
| float          | 32-bit single-precision floating point type    | -3.4 x 1038 to + 3.4 x 1038    | 0.0F    |
| Int          | 32-bit signed integer type    | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647    | 0    |
| long          | 64-bit signed integer type    | -923,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807    | 0L    |
| sbyte          | 8-bit signed integer type    | -128 to 127    | 0    |
| short          | 16-bit signed integer type    | -32,768 to 32,767     | 0    |
| uint          | 32-bit unsigned integer type    | 0 to 4,294,967,295    | 0    |
| 64-bit unsigned integer type          | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615    | True    | 0    |
| ushort          | 16-bit unsigned integer type     | 0 to 65,535    | 0    |

To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use 
the sizeof method

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace ConsoleApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Size of int: {0}", sizeof(int));
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
// Size of int: 4
```

## Reference types

The reference types do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they 
contain a reference to the variables.

In other words, they refer to a memory location. Using multiple variables, the 
reference types can refer to a memory location. If the data in the memory location 
is changed by one of the variables, the other variable automatically reflects this 
change in value. Example of built-in reference types 
are: object, dynamic, and string

**Object Type**

The Object Type is the ultimate base class for all data types in C# Common Type 
System (CTS). Object is an alias for System.Object class. The object types can be 
assigned values of any other types, value types, reference types, predefined or user-defined types. However, before assigning values, it needs type conversion.

**Dynamic Type**

You can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable. Type checking for 
these types of variables takes place at run-time

Dynamic types are similar to object types except that type checking for object type 
variables takes place at compile time

**String Type**

The String Type allows you to assign any string values to a variable. The string type 
is an alias for the System.String class. It is derived from object type. The value for a 
string type can be assigned using string literals in two forms: quoted and @quoted.


## Pointer types

Pointer type variables store the memory address of another type. Pointers in C# have 
the same capabilities as the pointers in C or C++

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            object obj;
            obj = 100;

            dynamic d = 20;

            String str = "Tutorials Point";
            // @"Tutorials Point";

            char* cptr;
            int* iptr;
        }
    }
}
```
