C# is an object-oriented programming language. In Object-Oriented Programming 
methodology, a program consists of various objects that interact with each other by 
means of actions. The actions that an object may take are called methods. Objects 
of the same kind are said to have the same type or, more often, are said to be in the 
same class.

For example, let us consider an object Rectangle. It has attributes such as length and 
width. Depending upon the design, it may need ways for accepting the values of 
these attributes, calculating area, and display details.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Demo
{
    class Rectangle
    {
        // member variables
        double length;
        double width;
        public void Acceptdetails()
        {
            length = 4.5;
            width = 3.5;
        }
        public double GetArea()
        {
            return length * width;
        }
        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", length);
            Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", width);
            Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", GetArea());
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
            r.Acceptdetails();
            r.Display();
            Console.ReadLine();
            // Length: 4.5
            // Width: 3.5
            // Area: 15.75
        }
    }
}
```

**The using keyword** is used for including the namespaces in the program. A program 
can include multiple using statements.

**The class keyword** is used for declaring a class.

**Comments** are used for explaining code. Compiler ignores the comment entries. The 
multiline comments in C# programs start with /* and terminates with the characters

**Variables** are attributes or data members of a class. They are used for storing data. 
In the preceding program, the Rectangle class has two member variables 
named length and width.

**Functions** are set of statements that perform a specific task. The member functions 
of a class are declared within the class. Our sample class Rectangle contains three 
member functions: AcceptDetails, GetArea, and Display

In the preceding program, the class ExecuteRectangle is used as a class, which 
contains the Main() method and instantiates the Rectangle class

An identifier is a name used to identify a class, variable, function, or any other userdefined item. The basic rules for naming classes in C# are as follows:

- A name must begin with a letter that could be followed by a sequence of letters, 
digits (0 - 9), or underscore. The first character in an identifier cannot be a 
digit.
- It must not contain any embedded space or symbol like ? - +! @ # % ^ & * ( 
) [ ] { } . ; : " ' / and \. However, an underscore ( _ ) can be used.
- It should not be a C# keyword
