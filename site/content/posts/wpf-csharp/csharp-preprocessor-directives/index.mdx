The preprocessor directives give instruction to the compiler to preprocess the 
information before actual compilation starts.

All preprocessor directives begin with #, and only white-space characters may appear 
before a preprocessor directive on a line. Preprocessor directives are not statements, 
so they do not end with a semicolon (;).

## Preprocessor Directives in C#

| Property               | Description                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #define | It defines a sequence of characters, called symbol.| 
| #undef | It allows you to undefine a symbol.| 
| #if | It allows testing a symbol or symbols to see if they evaluate to true.| 
| #else | It allows to create a compound conditional directive, along with #if.| 
| #elif | It allows creating a compound conditional directive.| 
| #endif | Specifies the end of a conditional directive.| 
| #line | It lets you modify the compiler's line number and (optionally) the file name output for errors and warnings.| 
| #error | It allows generating an error from a specific location in your code.| 
| #warning | It allows generating a level one warning from a specific location in your code.| 
| #region | It lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the outlining feature of the Visual Studio Code Editor.| 
| #endregion | It marks the end of a #region block.| 

## The #define Preprocessor

The #define preprocessor directive creates symbolic constants.

#define lets you define a symbol such that, by using the symbol as the expression 
passed to the #if directive, the expression evaluates to true. Its syntax is as follows:

```c#
#define PI 
using System;
namespace PreprocessorDAppl
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
#if (PI)
            Console.WriteLine("PI is defined");
#else
            Console.WriteLine("PI is not defined");
#endif
            Console.ReadKey();
            //PI is defined
        }
    }
}
```

## Conditional Directives

You can use the #if directive to create a conditional directive. Conditional directives 
are useful for testing a symbol or symbols to check if they evaluate to true. If they 
do evaluate to true, the compiler evaluates all the code between the #if and the next 
directive.

```c#
#define DEBUG
#define VC_V10
using System;
public class TestClass
{
    public static void Main()
    {
#if (DEBUG && !VC_V10)
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG is defined");
#elif (!DEBUG && VC_V10)
        Console.WriteLine("VC_V10 is defined");
#elif (DEBUG && VC_V10)
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG and VC_V10 are defined");
#else
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG and VC_V10 are not defined");
#endif
        Console.ReadKey();
        //DEBUG and VC_V10 are defined
    }
}
```
