## LOCALIZATION
---

Localization is the translation of application resources into localized versions for the specific 
cultures that the application supports.

In WPF, localizable applications are very easy to create with resx file which is the simplest 
solution for localization. Let’s take a simple example to understand how it works:

- In your solution explorer, you will see the Resources.resx file under Properties 
folder.

![solution explorer](./1.png 'solution explorer')

- Change the access modifier from internal to public so that it can be accessible in 
XAML file.

- Now add the following string’s name and values which we will be using in our 
application

![add the following string](./2.png 'add the following string')

- Make two copies of Resources.resx file with the names Resources.en.resx and 
Resources.ru-RU.resx. These are naming conventions specific to language and 
country/region name, and it can be found on National Language Support (NLS) API 
Reference (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb896001.aspx) page.

- In the XAML file, first add the namespace declaration to use localize resources
> xmlns:p="clr-namespace:WPFLocalization.Properties"

- Set the properties of all the controls as shown below. In this example, we will not 
use hardcoded strings for the content of labels, buttons, and Title of the window in 
XAML file. We will be using the strings which are defined in *.resx files. For 
example, for the Title of window, we use the Title string which is defined in *.resx 
file like this 
> Title="{x:Static p:Resources.Title}

- Here is the XAML file in which controls are created and initialized with different 
properties.

![example](./4.png 'example')

```c#
<Grid>
 <TextBox 
      x:Name="textBox" HorizontalAlignment="Left" Height="23" 
      Margin="128,45,0,0" TextWrapping="Wrap" 
      VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="304"/>
 <Label 
      x:Name="label" Content="{x:Static p:Resources.Name}" 
      HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="52,45,0,0" 
      VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="86"/>
 <Button 
      x:Name="button2" Content="{x:Static p:Resources.Help_Button}" 
      HorizontalAlignment="Left" Margin="392,241,0,0" 
      VerticalAlignment="Top" Width="75"/>
 </Grid>
```

- By default, the program uses the default Resources.resx. If you want to show the 
text in Russian language which are defined in Resources.ru-RU.resx file, then you 
will need to set the culture explicitly when the program starts in App.xaml file as 
shown below

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Configuration;
using System.Data;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows;

namespace Wpf2017
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Interaction logic for App.xaml
    /// </summary>
    public partial class App : Application
    {
        App()
        {
            System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("ru-RU");
            //System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en");
        }
    }
}
```
