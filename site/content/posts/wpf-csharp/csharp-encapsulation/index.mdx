Encapsulation is defined 'as the process of enclosing one or more items within a 
physical or logical package'. Encapsulation, in object oriented programming 
methodology, prevents access to implementation details.

Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access 
specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the 
following access specifiers:

- Public
- Private
- Protected
- Internal
- Protected internal

## Public Access Specifier

Public access specifier allows a class to expose its member variables and member 
functions to other functions and objects. Any public member can be accessed from 
outside the class.

In the example, the member variables length and width are 
declared public, so they can be accessed from the function Main() using an instance 
of the Rectangle class, named r

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        class Rectangle
        {
            //member variables
            public double length;
            public double width;
            public double GetArea()
            {
                return length * width;
            }
            public void Display()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", length);
                Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", width);
                Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", GetArea());
            }
        }//end class Rectangle 
        class ExecuteRectangle
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
                r.length = 4.5;
                r.width = 3.5;
                r.Display();
                Console.ReadLine();

                //Length: 4.5
                //Width: 3.5
                //Area: 15.75
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Private Access Specifier

Private access specifier allows a class to hide its member variables and member 
functions from other functions and objects. Only functions of the same class can 
access its private members. Even an instance of a class cannot access its private 
members.

In the example, the member variables length and width are 
declared private, so they cannot be accessed from the function Main()

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        class Rectangle
        {
            //member variables
            private double length;
            private double width;
            public void Acceptdetails()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Enter Length: ");
                length = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
                Console.WriteLine("Enter Width: ");
                width = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());
            }
            public double GetArea()
            {
                return length * width;
            }
            public void Display()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", length);
                Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", width);
                Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", GetArea());
            }
        }//end class Rectangle 
        class ExecuteRectangle
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
                r.Acceptdetails();
                r.Display();
                Console.ReadLine();
                //Enter Length:
                //4.4
                //Enter Width:
                //3.3
                //Length: 4.4
                //Width: 3.3
                //Area: 14.52
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Protected Access Specifier

Protected access specifier allows a child class to access the member variables and 
member functions of its base class. This way it helps in implementing inheritance. 
We will discuss this in more details in the inheritance chapter

Internal access specifier allows a class to expose its member variables and member 
functions to other functions and objects in the current assembly. In other words, any 
member with internal access specifier can be accessed from any class or method 
defined within the application in which the member is defined

In the example, notice that the member function GetArea() is not declared 
with any access specifier

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        class Rectangle
        {
            //member variables
            internal double length;
            internal double width;

            double GetArea()
            {
            return length * width;
            }
            public void Display()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Length: {0}", length);
                Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", width);
                Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", GetArea());
            }
        }//end class Rectangle 
        class ExecuteRectangle
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
                r.length = 4.5;
                r.width = 3.5;
                r.Display();
                Console.ReadLine();

                //Length: 4.5
                //Width: 3.5
                //Area: 15.75
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Protected Internal Access Specifier

The protected internal access specifier allows a class to hide its member variables 
and member functions from other class objects and functions, except a child class 
within the same application. This is also used while implementing inheritance
