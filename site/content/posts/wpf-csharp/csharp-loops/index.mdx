There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number 
of times. In general, the statements are executed sequentially: The first statement 
in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more 
complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or a group of statements multiple 
times and following is the general from of a loop statement in most of the 
programming languages:

| Loop Type               | Description                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| while loop              | It repeats a statement or a group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.    |
| for loop               | It executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.    |
| do...while loop              | It is similar to a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body    |
| nested loops              | You can use one or more loops inside any another while, for or do..while loop.    |

## While Loop

A while loop statement in C# repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a 
given condition is true

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            /* local variable definition */
            int a = 10;
            /* while loop execution */
            while (a < 20)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("value of a: {0}", a);
                a++;
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
            //value of a: 10
            //value of a: 11
            //value of a: 12
            //value of a: 13
            //value of a: 14
            //value of a: 15
            //value of a: 16
            //value of a: 17
            //value of a: 18
            //value of a: 19
        }
    }
}
```

## For Loop

A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop 
that needs to execute a specific number of times

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            /* for loop execution */
            for (int a = 10; a < 20; a = a + 1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("value of a: {0}", a);
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
            //value of a: 10
            //value of a: 11
            //value of a: 12
            //value of a: 13
            //value of a: 14
            //value of a: 15
            //value of a: 16
            //value of a: 17
            //value of a: 18
            //value of a: 19
        }
    }
}
```

## Do...While Loop

Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the start of the loop, the
do...while loop checks its condition at the end of the loop.

A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed 
to execute at least one time

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            /* local variable definition */
            int a = 10;
            /* do loop execution */
            do
            {
                Console.WriteLine("value of a: {0}", a);
                a = a + 1;
            } while (a < 20);
            Console.ReadLine();
            //value of a: 10
            //value of a: 11
            //value of a: 12
            //value of a: 13
            //value of a: 14
            //value of a: 15
            //value of a: 16
            //value of a: 17
            //value of a: 18
            //value of a: 19
        }
    }
}
```

## Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution 
leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

C# provides the following control statements. Click the following links to check their 
details

| Control Statement               | Description                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| break              | Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch. |
| continue              | Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. |

## Infinite Loop

A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is 
traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 
for loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional 
expression empty

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (; ; )
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hey! I am Trapped");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
