An interface is defined as a syntactical contract that all the classes inheriting the 
interface should follow. The interface defines the 'what' part of the syntactical 
contract and the deriving classes define the 'how' part of the syntactical contract.

Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the 
interface. Interfaces contain only the declaration of the members. It is the 
responsibility of the deriving class to define the members. It often helps in providing 
a standard structure that the deriving classes would follow.

Abstract classes to some extent serve the same purpose, however, they are mostly 
used when only few methods are to be declared by the base class and the deriving 
class implements the functionalities.

**Declaring Interfaces**

Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword. It is similar to class declaration. 
Interface statements are public by default. Following is an example of an interface 
declaration:

```c#
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp2022
{
    public interface ITransactions
    {
        // interface members
        void showTransaction();
        double getAmount();
    }
    public class Transaction : ITransactions
    {
        private string tCode;
        private string date;
        private double amount;
        public Transaction()
        {
            tCode = " ";
            date = " ";
            amount = 0.0;
        }
        public Transaction(string c, string d, double a)
        {
            tCode = c;
            date = d;
            amount = a;
        }
        public double getAmount()
        {
            return amount;
        }
        public void showTransaction()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Transaction: {0}", tCode);
            Console.WriteLine("Date: {0}", date);
            Console.WriteLine("Amount: {0}", getAmount());
        }
    }
    class Tester
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Transaction t1 = new Transaction("001", "8/10/2012", 78900.00);
            Transaction t2 = new Transaction("002", "9/10/2012", 451900.00);
            t1.showTransaction();
            t2.showTransaction();
            Console.ReadKey();
            //Transaction: 001
            //Date: 8 / 10 / 2012
            //Amount: 78900
            //Transaction: 002
            //Date: 9 / 10 / 2012
            //Amount: 451900
        }
    }
}
```
