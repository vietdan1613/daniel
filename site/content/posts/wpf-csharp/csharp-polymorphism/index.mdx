The word polymorphism means having many forms. In object-oriented 
programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as 'one interface, multiple 
functions'.

Polymorphism can be static or dynamic. In static polymorphism, the response to a 
function is determined at the compile time. In dynamic polymorphism , it is decided 
at run-time.

## Static Polymorphism

The mechanism of linking a function with an object during compile time is called early 
binding. It is also called static binding. C# provides two techniques to implement 
static polymorphism. They are:

1. Function overloading
2. Operator overloading

We discuss operator overloading in next chapter.

**Function Overloading**

You can have multiple definitions for the same function name in the same scope. The 
definition of the function must differ from each other by the types and/or the number 
of arguments in the argument list. You cannot overload function declarations that 
differ only by return type

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.NetworkInformation;

namespace ConsoleApp2022
{
    class Printdata
    {
        void print(int i)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Printing int: {0}", i);
        }
        void print(double f)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Printing float: {0}", f);
        }
        void print(string s)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Printing string: {0}", s);
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Printdata p = new Printdata();
            // Call print to print integer
            p.print(5);
            // Call print to print float
            p.print(500.263);
            // Call print to print string
            p.print("Hello C++");
            Console.ReadKey();

            //Printing int: 5
            //Printing float: 500.263
            //Printing string: Hello C++
        }
    }
}
```

## Dynamic Polymorphism

C# allows you to create abstract classes that are used to provide partial class 
implementation of an interface. Implementation is completed when a derived class 
inherits from it. Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which are implemented 
by the derived class. The derived classes have more specialized functionality.

Here are the rules about abstract classes:
- You cannot create an instance of an abstract class
- You cannot declare an abstract method outside an abstract class
- When a class is declared sealed, it cannot be inherited, abstract classes cannot 
be declared sealed.

When you have a function defined in a class that you want to be implemented in an 
inherited class(es), you use virtual functions. The virtual functions could be 
implemented differently in different inherited class and the call to these functions will 
be decided at runtime.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.NetworkInformation;

namespace ConsoleApp2022
{
    class Shape
    {
        protected int width, height;
        public Shape(int a = 0, int b = 0)
        {
            width = a;
            height = b;
        }
        public virtual int area()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Parent class area :");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    class Rectangle : Shape
    {
        public Rectangle(int a = 0, int b = 0) : base(a, b)
        {
        }
        public override int area()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Rectangle class area :");
            return (width * height);
        }
    }
    class Triangle : Shape
    {
        public Triangle(int a = 0, int b = 0) : base(a, b)
        {

        }
        public override int area()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Triangle class area :");
            return (width * height / 2);
        }
    }
    class Caller
    {
        public void CallArea(Shape sh)
        {
            int a;
            a = sh.area();
            Console.WriteLine("Area: {0}", a);
        }
    }
    class Tester
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Caller c = new Caller();
            Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 7);
            Triangle t = new Triangle(10, 5);
            c.CallArea(r);
            c.CallArea(t);
            Console.ReadKey();
            //Rectangle class area:
            //Area: 70
            //Triangle class area:
            //Area: 25
        }
    }
}
```
