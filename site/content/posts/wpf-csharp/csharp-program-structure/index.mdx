## Background

Before we study basic building blocks of the C# programming language, let us look 
at a bare minimum C# program structure so that we can take it as a reference in 
upcoming chapters.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Demo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            /* my first program in C# */
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

*The first line of the program **using System;** - the using keyword is used to 
include the **System namespace** in the program. A program generally has 
multiple using statements.*

*The next line has the **namespace declaration**. A **namespace** is a collection of 
**classes**. The HelloWorldApplication namespace contains the class HelloWorld*

*The next line has a class declaration, the **class HelloWorld** contains the **data** 
and **method definitions** that your program uses. Classes generally contain 
multiple methods. Methods define the behavior of the class. However, the
HelloWorld class has only one method Main.*

The next line defines the **Main method**, which is the entry point for all C# 
programs. The Main method states what the class does when executed

The next line /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is put to add 
**comments** in the program.

The Main method specifies its behavior with the statement
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

WriteLine is a method of the Console class defined in the System namespace. 
This statement causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the 
screen

The last line Console.ReadKey(); is for the VS.NET Users. This makes the 
program wait for a key press and it prevents the screen from running and 
closing quickly when the program is launched from Visual Studio .NET.
