# Researchers Make Surprising Discovery about Ancient Mosquitoes

**A**   
Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are killed every year by malaria and other diseases that are 
spread through mosquito bites. 

**B**   
Female mosquitoes are responsible for these deadly bites because they have a special mouth design that male 
mosquitoes do not have. 

**C**   
But it has not always been that way. Researchers said they have discovered the oldest-known fossils of 
mosquitoes - two males located in pieces of an ancient orange-colored substance known as amber. 

**D**   
The male mosquitoes date to 130 million years ago. They were found near the modern town of Hammana in 
Lebanon. To researchers' surprise, the male mosquitoes had long mouthparts seen now only in females. 

**E**   
Dany Azar is a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology 
and Lebanese University. Azar said they were clearly blood-eaters. The lead writer of the study, recently
published in Current Biology, added, "This discovery is a major one in the evolutionary history of mosquitoes." 

**F**   
The two fossilized mosquitoes, both representing the same species that has died off, are similar in size and
appearance to modern mosquitoes. However, the mouthparts used for getting blood are shorter than in today's
female mosquitoes.

**G**   
Study co-writer André Nel of the National Museum of Natural History of Paris described the finding
as "quite surprising." 

**H**   
The special anatomy of the two mosquitoes was beautifully saved in the fossils. Both insects had sharp and
triangle-shaped jaw anatomy and a long structure with tooth-like elements. 

**I**   
The researchers said they suspect that mosquitoes evolved from insects that did not consume blood.
They think that the mouthparts that were developed for getting blood meals were originally used to pierce plants
to get nutritious fluids. 

**J**   
Plant evolution may have affected the differences in feeding between male and female mosquitoes. At
the time when these two mosquitoes became stuck in tree sap that eventually became amber, flowering plants
were beginning to spread for the first time. 

**K**   
From the findings, Azar said that all early mosquitoes, both male and female, were bloodsucking. And
male mosquitoes lost the ability later. 

**L**   
The researchers said while these are the oldest mosquito fossils, mosquitoes probably appeared millions
of years earlier. They noted that molecular evidence suggests mosquitoes developed from about 200 million
to 145 million years ago. 

**M**   
There are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes worldwide, found everywhere except Antarctica. Some species
spread diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, Zika fever, dengue and others. The World Health Organization
says more than 400,000 people die annually from malaria - a parasitic infection - mostly children under age 5.

# The Story of the Mammoth

![example](./2.jpg 'example')

The mammoth is the classic ice age creature, often depicted wandering the steppe and towering over humans. Their closest contemporary relatives are elephants, but a mammoth
typically had longer, curved tusks, and a covering of shaggy brown hair. As their name suggests, they were extremely large, with the biggest species reaching heights of
around 13 feet at the shoulder. The mystery of the mammoth is why exactly these giant creatures died out.

Woolly mammoths are probably the best known of the mammoths because their remains have been so extensively studied and documented, as many well-preserved specimens have
been found. They were not the largest mammoth species, but at between 9 and 11 feet tall they were around the same height as an African elephant. The woolly mammoth's habitat
was the vast ecosystem known as the mammoth steppe. They were perfectly suited to the extreme conditions on the steppe, which included freezing temperatures and a dry climate.

As with other mammoth species, most woolly mammoths died out in the early Holocene (the geological era that followed the last ice age), around 10,000 years ago. However, a
small number of woolly mammoths survived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Circle, where they lived until around 2500 BC, the time the pyramids were built in Egypt.
The reasons for the extinction of the mammoth are still debated, with some claiming climate change was the most significant factor, while others speculate that it was disease, or
that humans killed them off. Humans did migrate across areas where mammoths resided during this period, while also developing new weapons which could have allowed them to hunt
large creatures like mammoths.

However, the most likely scenario is that a variety of factors contributed to the mammoth's disappearance. The warming climate in the early Holocene did have an impact on the
habitat of the mammoth steppe, which gradually changed from grassy terrain to wetlands. This could have forced mammoths into much smaller habitats, where they could easily be
targeted by human hunters. Furthermore, these small, isolated populations of mammoths were prey to disease and general weakness because of inbreeding
