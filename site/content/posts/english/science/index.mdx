# Three dimensional films

![example](./3d.jpg 'example')

A. In the theatre of the **Ambassador** Hotel in **Los Angeles**, on the evening of 27 September 1922, a new form of 
film-making made its commercial debut: 3-D 1 . The film, The Power of Love , was then shown in New York City 
to **exhibitors** and **press**, but was subsequently not picked up for distribution and is now believed to be lost. 
The following three decades were **a period of** quiet experimentation for 3-D **pioneers**, as they adapted to new 
technologies and **steadily** improved the viewing experience. In 1952 the 'golden **era**' of 3-D is considered to 
have begun with the release of Bwana Devil , and over the next several years audiences met with a string of 
films that used the technology. Over the following decades it **waxed and waned** within film-making circles, 
**peaking** in the 1970s and again in the 1990s when IMAX gained traction, but it is only in the last few years 
that 3-D appears to have firmly entered mainstream production.

B. Released worldwide in December 2009, the fantasy film Avatar quickly became the highest-grossing film ever made, 
knocking Titanic from the top slot. Avatar , set in 2154 on a planet in a distant **solar** system, went on to become 
the only film to have earned US$2 billion world-wide, and is now approaching the $3 billion mark. The main reason 
for its **runaway** **popularity** appears to be its visual **splendour**; though most **critics** **praised** the film, it was mostly 
on account of its **ground-breaking** special effects. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised Avatar's 'powerful' 
visual accomplishments, but suggested the **dialogue** was '**flat**' and the characterisations '**obvious**'. A film analyst at 
Exhibitor Relations has agreed, noting that Avatar has **cemented** the use of 3-D as a production and promotional tool 
for **blockbuster** films, **rather than** as a **mere** **niche** or **novelty** experiment. 'This is why all these 3-D **venues** were built', 
he said. 'This is the one. The **behemoth**... **The holy grail** of 3-D has finally arrived'.

C. Those who **embrace** 3-D note that it **spices up** a trip to the cinema by adding a more active '**embodied**' layer of 
experience instead of the viewer passively receiving the film through eyes and ears only. A blogger on Animation 
Ideas writes, '...when 3-D is done well—like in the flying scenes in Up , How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar , 
there is an added feeling of **vertigo**. If you have any fear of heights, the 3-D really adds to this element...' Kevin 
Carr argues that the **backlash** against 3-D is similar to that which occurred against CGI 2 several years ago, and 
points out that CGI is now widely **regarded** as part of the film-maker's artistic toolkit. He also notes that new 
technology is frequently seen to be a '**gimmick**' in its early days, pointing out that many **commentators** slapped 
the first 'talkie' films of the early 1920s with this same label.

D. But not everyone **greets** the rise of 3-D with open arms. Some **ophthalmologists** point out that 3-D can have 
**unsettling** physical effects for many viewers. Dr. Michael Rosenberg, a professor at Northwestern University, 
has pointed out that many people go through life with **minor eye** **disturbances—a** **slight** **muscular** imbalance, 
for example—that does not interrupt day-to-day activities. In the experience of a 3-D movie, however, this 
problem can be **exacerbated** through the viewer trying to concentrate on unusual visual **phenomena**. Dr. Deborah 
Friedman, from the University of Rochester Medical Center, notes that the perception of depth **conjured** through 
three dimensions does not **complement** the **angles** from which we take in the world. **Eyestrains**, headaches and 
**nausea** are therefore a problem for around 15% of a 3-D film audience.

E. Film **critic** Roger Ebert warns that 3-D is **detrimental** to good film-making. Firstly, he argues, the technology is 
simply unnecessary; 2-D movies are 'already' 3-D, as far as our minds are concerned. Adding the extra dimension 
with technology, instead of letting our minds do the work, can actually be counter-purposeful and make the over-all 
effect seem **clumsy** and **contrived**. Ebert also points out that the special glasses **dim** the effect by **soaking up** light 
from the screen, making 3-D films a **slightly** **duller** experience than they might **otherwise** be. Finally, Ebert suggests 
that 3-D encourages film-makers to **undercut** drama and **narrative** in **favour of** simply **piling** on more **gimmicks** and special 
effects. 'Hollywood is racing **headlong** toward the kiddie market,' he says, pointing to Disney's **announcement** that it 
will no longer make traditional films in favour of animation, **franchises**, and superheroes.

F. Whether or not 3-D becomes a powerful **force** for the film-maker's **vision** and the film-going experience, or goes down in 
history as an **over-hyped**, expensive **novelty**, the technology certainly shows no signs of **fading** in the popularity stakes 
at the moment. Clash of the Titans , Alice in Wonderland and How to Train Your Dragon have all recently benefited at the 
box office due to the added sales that 3-D provides, and with Avatar's record set to last some time as a totem of 3-D's 
commercial possibilities, studios are not prepared to back down.

# AI Robot Finds Way to Produce Oxygen from Water on Mars

![example](./0.jpg 'example')

Chinese researchers say they have built an artificial intelligence (AI) robot that can carry 
out chemical reactions to produce oxygen from water on Mars. 

The system could be another way for space travelers in the future to make much-needed
oxygen on Mars. Humans visiting the Red Planet will need oxygen to support life. The gas 
could also be used to make rocket fuel, which is difficult to transport to space.

Scientists have already established from multiple studies that Mars contains large amounts
of water. Most of the water exists in the form of ice. Developers of the new robot
system in China say it can be used to release oxygen from the planet’s water supply.

Scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei led the research.
The team explored whether an AI robot could use materials found on Mars to produce
catalysts to break down water and release oxygen. A catalyst is a substance that permits
certain chemical reactions to happen.

Experiments were carried out on meteorites that either came from Mars or contained materials
similar to the Martian surface. The researchers said the “robot chemist” first used an
acid and chemical mixture to separate and examine materials contained in the meteorites. It 
identified several different metallic elements, including iron, nickel, magnesium and aluminum.

![example](./1.jpg 'example')

The machine then worked to identify different molecules that could be produced from meteorite
materials. The team said the system found more than 3.7 million possible molecule
combinations.

The robot used that data to predict which catalysts would be able to split water molecules 
to produce oxygen. The catalyst chosen as the best fit was able to operate at minus 37
degrees Celsius. This temperature is similar to current conditions on Mars.

A press release announcing the experimental findings said the AI chemist was able to
complete the whole process without human involvement in just two months. The release
claimed such an operation “would take 2000 years for a human chemist” to finish.

The publication Nature Synthesis reported the full results of the study.

The study’s lead writer, Jun Jiang, told the website Space.com that as a boy, he often
dreamed of being able to one day travel in space. "So when we finally saw that the
catalysts made by the robot could actually produce oxygen by splitting water molecules, I
felt like my dream was coming true. I even started to imagine that I, myself, will live
on Mars in the future."

The researchers said they plan next to test whether their AI system performs well under
a series of other conditions – besides temperature – found on Mars

A report explaining the study’s results in Nature notes Jiang suggests that for every
square meter of Martian material, his group’s system could produce nearly 60 grams of
oxygen per hour. The researchers say this level of production could remove the need for
future astronauts to transport oxygen from Earth. “The robot can work continuously for
years,” Jiang said.

Jiang told Nature he thinks his team’s robotic system could also be used to produce
other useful catalysts on Mars. This could include processes for making substances to
support the growth of plants that could be used to produce food for astronauts.

“Different chemicals can be made by this robot,” Jiang said. He noted that Mars might
also not be the only place where it could find other uses, suggesting the moon as
another possibility

# 2023 Likely to Be Warmest Year in Recorded History

**A**

European researchers say a very hot October has put 2023 on a likely path to become the
warmest year in recorded history.

**B**

Last month, world temperatures beat a 2019 record for warmest October on record by 0.4
degrees, scientists from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service announced.
The EU agency issues monthly reports on climate observations across Europe. 

**C**

The latest October record nearly guarantees that 2023 will be the hottest year on record,
said Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess. “The amount that we're smashing records
by is shocking,” Burgess told The Associated Press (AP). 

**D**  
Scientists have long linked rising world temperatures to gases from the burning of fossil fuels. El Niño has also been warming ocean waters this year.

**E**  
El Niño is a warming of surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. The event usually causes hot, dry weather in Asia and Australia and can drive weather changes in other parts of the world.

![example](./1.jpg 'example')

**F**  
The World Meteorological Organization has predicted the El Niño weather pattern will last until at least April 2024. 

**G**  
Michael Mann is a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. He told the AP that most El Niño years now become record-breakers because that climate event combines with rising temperatures linked to human causes. 

**H**  
A warmer planet means more extreme and intense weather events like severe drought or hurricanes that hold more water, said Peter Schlosser. He is vice president of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Schlosser was not involved with the Copernicus report. 

**I**  
“We better take this warning that we actually should have taken 50 years ago or more and draw the right conclusions,” Schlosser said. He added that this means the world should expect more records to be broken as a result of that warming. But he questions whether the changes will come in smaller steps going forward. 

![example](./2.jpg 'example')

**J**  
Schlosser noted Earth was already reaching temperatures above the 1.5 degrees Celsius target limit established by the Paris agreement on climate change. He said the latest observations are another sign there is an urgent need for action to help stop planet-warming pollution. 

**K**  
It's so much more expensive to keep burning these fossil fuels than it would be to stop doing it. That's basically what it shows, said Friederike Otto. She is a climate scientist at Imperial College London. “And of course, you don't see that when you just look at the records being broken and not at the people and systems that are suffering,” Otto said. “But that… is what matters.” 

**L**  
The findings from Copernicus come three weeks before a United Nations meeting in the United Arab Emirates capital of Dubai, known as COP28. Delegates from nearly 200 countries will attend the gathering. They are seeking to negotiate stronger action to fight climate change.
