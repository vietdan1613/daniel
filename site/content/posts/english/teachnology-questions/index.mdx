## 1. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF?

I'm a full stack developer, proficient in designing user interactions on websites and designing APIs. I love 
designing apps to create an extraordinary user experience. I believe in lifelong learning and always looking 
for ways to improve myself, I may be a good fit for your company.

## 2. WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?

I also have a background in design, which allows me to feel in my element when collaborating with a UI/UX designer.
I can easily understand their ideas in the same perspective. I make sure to set estimates and expectations from very early 
to avoid any potential misunderstandings and bottlenecks in the future.

## 3. WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?

I can be a bit shy to speak in meetings. I am often think that my ideas will be harshly judged even when I know 
that won't be the case. So I’m working on building up my confidence and not being afraid to pitch ideas by 
attending speaking clubs where I get to talk to other people in the IT field. I’ve improved a lot in the past 
couple of months.

## 4. TELL ME ABOUT A CHALLENGE YOU’VE ENCOUNTERED. HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH IT?

The project that I found most challenging was the test automation system. This project was built on the 
Python language for 6 months before I joined. You know, I mainly code in Javascript language so when I 
switched to another programming language, I encountered a lot of problems. I spent a few weeks learning 
how the current system works and then I created over 100 test cases in 8 months. After that, I trained 
2 novices. Luckily, it only took 1 month for them to take over my work before I could join another project

## 5. HAVE YOU EVER RECEIVED DIFFICULT FEEDBACK OR HAD A DISAGREEMENT WITH A COWORKER? HOW DID YOU HANDLE THE SITUATION?

In the past, I’ve always resolve conflict by speaking to my coworker directly in a professional manner and 
trying to give a work out solution that would be beneficial for our common goal.  If we fail to reach a 
consensus, I will send the issue to our Project Manager. 

## 6. TELL ME ABOUT A TIME YOU HELPED IMPROVE OR INNOVATE SOMETHING

once time I took over an existing web app project as a UX designer. I soon realized that the previous design 
had multiple UX issues. I spent a couple of weeks redesigning the UX and UI. The goal was to make the app more 
user friendly and improve the user experience. After we launded the new design, the conversion rate went up 
by 50%
