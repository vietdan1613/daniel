# Conditional

## First Conditional

The First Conditional, also known as the Real Conditional, is used to talk about real and possible situations in the present or future. 
It typically consists of two clauses: the "if" clause (conditional clause) and the main clause (result clause).

> If + present simple, will/can/may/might + base form

1. If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.   
2. If he studies hard, he can pass the exam.    
3. If you finish your work early, you may go to the party.  

In the First Conditional, the "if" clause expresses a condition that is likely to happen in the present or future, and the main clause 
expresses the result or consequence of that condition.

## Second Conditional

The Second Conditional, also known as the Unreal Conditional, is used to talk about hypothetical or imaginary situations in the present 
or future, or unlikely events in the present. It typically consists of two clauses: the "if" clause (conditional clause) and the main 
clause (result clause).

> If + past simple, would/could/might + base form

1. If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world.   
2. If she had more time, she could learn a new language.    
3. If it snowed tomorrow, we might build a snowma   

In the Second Conditional, the "if" clause expresses a condition that is not likely to happen in the present or future, and the main 
clause expresses the hypothetical result or consequence of that condition.
