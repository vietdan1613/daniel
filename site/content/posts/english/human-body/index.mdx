Good afternoon and thank you for your warm welcome. This will be the first talk in a series of five on Health **interventions** —protection and prevention . 
Could I start by asking for a show of hands—how many of you had a **flu** vaccination at the beginning of winter? Mmm...I thought so. You young ones always 
think you're **indestructible**.

Well, as you are no **doubt** aware disease-spreading **germs** or **pathogens** are everywhere. On a daily basis the human body has to **ward off** attacks by various 
harmful **bacteria** and viruses. A healthy body has a good defence system against many of these germs but the defence only **operates** well against **micro-organisms** 
that it has already encountered, in which case it is said to be immune. There are two ways in which humans acquire natural immunity: actively, 
when a person has first **suffered** and then recovered from an illness , and passively, when ready-made protection is transferred into the body, for example, 
from the **maternal** blood via the **umbilical cord** to an unborn child, or through **breast** milk.

Now, artificially **acquired** immunity can help the body to fight disease so we can use active immunisation as a preventative measure. 
This is when a person is vaccinated against an illness by **injection** or **oral ingestion** of a tiny amount of weakened or inactive germs—not enough to actually 
cause him or her to contract the illness but **sufficient** for the body's defence system to recognise and respond to the **threat by** forming antibodies.

**Intervention** using passive immunlsation, on the other hand, is a method of curing an illness after it is too late for prevention. It is less effective than active 
immunisation and takes longer to work. It is used when the body has already been **invaded** by bacteria and the person is ill. In this case there is no time for the 
body to make antibodies of its own so proteins—usually taken from the blood of animals—are injected to **equip** the patient with the essential antibodies to combat 
the particular illness.

Let's have a quick look at a bit of history: The discovery of vaccination to boost the body's immune system by making it sensitive to particular disease-causing 
bacteria was made by an eighteenth-century English doctor called Edward Jenner. He noticed that survivors of smallpox, a common but extremely dangerous disease, 
never **contracted** the disease a second time. In other words, they were immune. He studied a similar disease in cows called **cowpox** and realised that people in contact 
with the **infected** cows became ill with symptoms **resembling** **smallpox**. However, this disease was quite **mild** by comparison and those who contracted cowpox were then 
immune to smallpox. He conducted an experiment by injecting a child with a small amount of pus taken from a cowpox **pustule**. The child subsequently became ill but soon recovered. 
Later, he injected the child with pus from a smallpox pustule and the child did not get sick. He had developed immunity to the more dangerous disease. 
The antibodies produced to fight the cowpox bacteria had been able to fight off the smallpox bacteria.

What are antibodies? Well, antibodies are made by white blood cells called B-lymphocytes . And this is done in response to the presence of antigens, or other bacterial **toxins**, 
which have been released by the micro-organisms (what we commonly refer to as 'germs') that have invaded the body. These Y-shaped antibodies (or you can think of them as 'antitoxins') 
may stop the toxins or repair the damage they have done by what is known as the antigen-antibody reaction which takes place within the **plasma** of the blood. 
A correct antibody (for that disease) **clings** to a particular antigen in order to render it harmless. Large numbers of these pairs clump together to form a bigger unit. 
This is called **agglutination** and is able to be seen by the naked eye which is very helpful for doctors and other **specialists** to determine which illnesses a patient is immune to.

**Inoculation**, or active vaccination, can protect people from serious diseases. The vaccine may make a person feel unwell for a few days when the immune system starts to produce 
antibodies to match the introduced antigen. This is called a primary reaction. If that particular antigen should ever enter the body again later, a secondary reaction takes place. 
The body is then able to produce large numbers of corresponding antibodies within a short time so the invading antigens are quickly **wiped out** without the person suffering any harm from the disease.
