A. In the theatre of the **Ambassador** Hotel in **Los Angeles**, on the evening of 27 September 1922, a new form of 
film-making made its commercial debut: 3-D 1 . The film, The Power of Love , was then shown in New York City 
to **exhibitors** and **press**, but was subsequently not picked up for distribution and is now believed to be lost. 
The following three decades were **a period of** quiet experimentation for 3-D **pioneers**, as they adapted to new 
technologies and **steadily** improved the viewing experience. In 1952 the 'golden **era**' of 3-D is considered to 
have begun with the release of Bwana Devil , and over the next several years audiences met with a string of 
films that used the technology. Over the following decades it **waxed and waned** within film-making circles, 
**peaking** in the 1970s and again in the 1990s when IMAX gained traction, but it is only in the last few years 
that 3-D appears to have firmly entered mainstream production.

B. Released worldwide in December 2009, the fantasy film Avatar quickly became the highest-grossing film ever made, 
knocking Titanic from the top slot. Avatar , set in 2154 on a planet in a distant **solar** system, went on to become 
the only film to have earned US$2 billion world-wide, and is now approaching the $3 billion mark. The main reason 
for its **runaway** **popularity** appears to be its visual **splendour**; though most **critics** **praised** the film, it was mostly 
on account of its **ground-breaking** special effects. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised Avatar's 'powerful' 
visual accomplishments, but suggested the **dialogue** was '**flat**' and the characterisations '**obvious**'. A film analyst at 
Exhibitor Relations has agreed, noting that Avatar has **cemented** the use of 3-D as a production and promotional tool 
for **blockbuster** films, **rather than** as a **mere** **niche** or **novelty** experiment. 'This is why all these 3-D **venues** were built', 
he said. 'This is the one. The **behemoth**... **The holy grail** of 3-D has finally arrived'.

C. Those who **embrace** 3-D note that it **spices up** a trip to the cinema by adding a more active '**embodied**' layer of 
experience instead of the viewer passively receiving the film through eyes and ears only. A blogger on Animation 
Ideas writes, '...when 3-D is done well—like in the flying scenes in Up , How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar , 
there is an added feeling of **vertigo**. If you have any fear of heights, the 3-D really adds to this element...' Kevin 
Carr argues that the **backlash** against 3-D is similar to that which occurred against CGI 2 several years ago, and 
points out that CGI is now widely **regarded** as part of the film-maker's artistic toolkit. He also notes that new 
technology is frequently seen to be a '**gimmick**' in its early days, pointing out that many **commentators** slapped 
the first 'talkie' films of the early 1920s with this same label.

D. But not everyone **greets** the rise of 3-D with open arms. Some **ophthalmologists** point out that 3-D can have 
**unsettling** physical effects for many viewers. Dr. Michael Rosenberg, a professor at Northwestern University, 
has pointed out that many people go through life with **minor eye** **disturbances—a** **slight** **muscular** imbalance, 
for example—that does not interrupt day-to-day activities. In the experience of a 3-D movie, however, this 
problem can be **exacerbated** through the viewer trying to concentrate on unusual visual **phenomena**. Dr. Deborah 
Friedman, from the University of Rochester Medical Center, notes that the perception of depth **conjured** through 
three dimensions does not **complement** the **angles** from which we take in the world. **Eyestrains**, headaches and 
**nausea** are therefore a problem for around 15% of a 3-D film audience.

E. Film **critic** Roger Ebert warns that 3-D is **detrimental** to good film-making. Firstly, he argues, the technology is 
simply unnecessary; 2-D movies are 'already' 3-D, as far as our minds are concerned. Adding the extra dimension 
with technology, instead of letting our minds do the work, can actually be counter-purposeful and make the over-all 
effect seem **clumsy** and **contrived**. Ebert also points out that the special glasses **dim** the effect by **soaking up** light 
from the screen, making 3-D films a **slightly** **duller** experience than they might **otherwise** be. Finally, Ebert suggests 
that 3-D encourages film-makers to **undercut** drama and **narrative** in **favour of** simply **piling** on more **gimmicks** and special 
effects. 'Hollywood is racing **headlong** toward the kiddie market,' he says, pointing to Disney's **announcement** that it 
will no longer make traditional films in favour of animation, **franchises**, and superheroes.

F. Whether or not 3-D becomes a powerful **force** for the film-maker's **vision** and the film-going experience, or goes down in 
history as an **over-hyped**, expensive **novelty**, the technology certainly shows no signs of **fading** in the popularity stakes 
at the moment. Clash of the Titans , Alice in Wonderland and How to Train Your Dragon have all recently benefited at the 
box office due to the added sales that 3-D provides, and with Avatar's record set to last some time as a totem of 3-D's 
commercial possibilities, studios are not prepared to back down.
