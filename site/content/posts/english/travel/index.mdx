# When You Travel, Do You Go to Ukraine or Do You Go to The Ukraine?

The complex history of using the definite article with certain country names

A   
Geographical names are not chosen arbitrarily, and there are often specific political reasons for their use. For example, names frequently reflect the
interests of the ruling class and change over time as regimes change. This is the reason many areas in Eurasia had different names before and after the
breakup of the Soviet Union. Ethnic considerations also play a key role; the same town in Iraq is called 'Arbil' by Arabs but is known as 'HewlÃªr' to Kurds.

B   
Such variability in geographical names can impede communication, so a system of standardisation is desirable. The need for a standardised system of geographic
names in English was recognised by the commanders of the Royal Navy during World War I. To serve this purpose, they created the Permanent Committee on
Geographical Names (PCGN) in 1919. The PCGN sets and applies the rules for all geographical names in the UK. The committee also publishes a list of all
recognised conventions for foreign place names and promotes the international standardisation of geographical names in cooperation with the United Nations.

C   
One of the most challenging decisions in practice for many people is whether to use the definite article in the name of a country. For example, should we
write 'United Kingdom' or 'The United Kingdom'? According to the PCGN and other authorities, only two official names should carry a definite article: The
Bahamas and The Gambia. In the case of The Gambia, the decision seems to have been in part due to political will. The PCGN still has a 1964 letter from
the prime minister of Gambia specifically instructing the committee to use 'The Gambia', reportedly to help distinguish itself from another African country
with a similar name: Zambia.

D   
Yet this official position on geographical names is sometimes complicated by linguistic issues. When inserted into sentences, some geographical names seem
to require the definite article to meet grammatical expectations or simply to sound natural. This is particularly true with country names that are associated
with geographical features, such as rivers, islands, or deserts. It is also common when the English user knows the literal meaning of the country name. In
such cases, people may include the definite article as part of the name. For instance, 'Netherlands' means 'low countries' in English, so it makes perfect
sense to use 'I'm going to the Netherlands' because 'I'm going to the low countries' requires 'the'. But in this case, 'the' is not part of the official
name, so it is not capitalised.

E   
In fact, there is a lack of widespread uniformity in the way people implement the prescribed standards. This can be seen in the use of 'Ukraine'. One may find
that one media source writes 'Ukraine' while another uses 'The Ukraine' Which is correct? According to the Ukrainian Embassy, the name of the country should
not be accompanied by the definite article in text written after 1991, the year of Ukrainian independence. The definite article stems from the period of Soviet
rule, when the region was known as The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. This means that the many writers who routinely retain the definite article to refer
to this period are technically incorrect. But expecting the general population to keep track of changes like this is a tall order.
