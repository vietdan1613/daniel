# A disaster of Titanic proportions

![example](./1.jpg 'example')

At 11.39 p.m. on the evening of Sunday 14 April 1912, lookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee on the forward **mast** of the Titanic 
sighted an **eerie**, black **mass** coming into view directly in front of the ship. Fleet picked up the phone to the **helm**, waited for Sixth 
Officer Moody to answer, and yelled '**Iceberg**, right ahead!' The greatest disaster in **maritime** history was about to be set in motion.

Thirty-seven seconds later, despite the efforts of officers in the bridge and engine room to **steer** around the iceberg, the Titanic 
struck a piece of **submerged** ice, **bursting** **rivets** in the ship's **hull** and **flooding** the first five **watertight** **compartments**. The ship's 
designer, Thomas Andrews, **carried out** a **visual** **inspection** of the ship's damage and informed Captain Smith at midnight that the ship 
would **sink** in less than two hours. By 12.30 a.m., the **lifeboats** were being filled with women and children, after Smith had given 
the command for them to be **uncovered** and **swung out** 15 minutes earlier. The first lifeboat was successfully lowered 15 minutes 
later, with only 28 of its 65 seats occupied. By 1.15 a.m., the waterline was beginning to reach the Titanic's name on the **ship's 
bow**, and over the next hour every lifeboat would be released as officers struggled to maintain order amongst the growing **panic** on board.

The closing moments of the Titanic's sinking began shortly after 2 a.m., as the last lifeboat was lowered and the ship's **propellers** 
**lifted out** of the water, leaving the 1,500 passengers still on board to **surge** towards the **stern**. At 2.17 a.m., Harold Bride and 
Jack Philips tapped out their last wireless message after being **relieved of** **duty** as the ship's wireless operators, and the ship's 
band stopped playing. Less than a minute later, **occupants** of the lifeboats **witnessed** the ship's lights flash once, then go black, and 
a huge **roar** signalled the Titanic's contents **plunging** towards the bow, causing the front half of the ship to break off and go under. 
The Titanic's stern **bobbed up** **momentarily**, and at 2.20 a.m., the ship finally disappeared beneath the **frigid** waters.

What or who was responsible for the scale of this **catastrophe**? Explanations abound, some that focus on very small details. Due to 
a last minute change in the ship's officer **line-up**, iceberg **lookouts** Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee were making do without a pair 
of **binoculars** that an officer transferred off the ship in Southampton had left in a **cupboard** onboard, **unbeknownst** to any of the ship's 
*crew*. Fleet, who survived the sinking, **insisted** at a **subsequent inquiry** that he could have identified the iceberg in time to **avert** 
disaster if he had been in **possession** of the binoculars.

Less than an hour before the Titanic struck the iceberg, wireless operator Cyril Evans on the Californian , located just 20 miles 
to the north, tried to contact operator Jack Philips on the Titanic to warn him of pack ice in the area. 'Shut up, shut up, you're 
jamming my signal', Philips replied. 'I'm busy.' The Titanic's wireless system had broken down for several hours earlier that day, and 
Philips was clearing a **backlog** of personal messages that passengers had requested to be sent to family and friends in the USA. 
**Nevertheless**, Captain Smith had maintained the ship's speed of 22 knots despite multiple earlier warnings of ice ahead. It has 
been suggested that Smith was **under pressure** to make headlines by arriving early in New York, but maritime historians such as 
Richard Howell have **countered** this **perception**, noting that Smith was simply following common **procedure** at the time, and 
not behaving **recklessly**.

One of the strongest explanations for the **severe** loss of life has been the fact that the Titanic did not carry enough lifeboats 
for everyone on board. Maritime **regulations** at the time tied lifeboat **capacity** to ship size, not to the number of passengers on board. 
This meant that the Titanic , with room for 1,178 of its 2,222 passengers, actually **surpassed** the Board of Trade's requirement that it 
carry lifeboats for 1,060 of its passengers. Nevertheless, with lifeboats being lowered less than half full in many cases, and only 712 
passengers surviving despite a two and a half hour window of opportunity, more lifeboats would not have guaranteed more survivors in the 
**absence** of better training and preparation. Many passengers were confused about where to go after the order to launch lifeboats was given; 
a lifeboat **drill scheduled** for earlier on the same day that the Titanic struck the iceberg was cancelled by Captain Smith, in order to 
allow passengers to attend **church**.
