# King Charles III Honors K-Pop Girl Group Blackpink

King Charles III honored the K-pop band Blackpink on November 22 for their work in raising awareness about climate change, as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged closer cooperation between their two countries on technology and defense.

On the second day of Yoon's three-day state visit to London, Charles made Blackpink members Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim and Lalisa Manoban honorary Members of the Order of the British Empire.

**C**   
Band member Roseanne (Rosé) Park also received an MBE, though hers came without the "honorary" qualifier because she also has citizenship in New Zealand, one of the 14 countries where the King Charles is head of state.

**D**   
The honors were presented during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in recognition of Blackpink's role in promoting the work of the COP26 summit on climate change two years ago in Glasgow, Scotland. The awards are part of Britain's honors system, which recognizes outstanding service to the nation and the wider world.

**E**   
Charles had lauded the K-pop girl group the previous day during a state banquet in honor of Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee "for their role in bringing the message of environmental sustainability to a global audience."

**F**   
"I can only admire how they can prioritize these vital issues, as well as being global superstars," Charles said.

**G**   
The Korean president is being treated to royal and diplomatic pomp on the visit, which the UK government hopes will help secure an Indo-Pacific focus in its foreign and trade policy.

Yoon met Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the British leader's 10 Downing Street residence for talks on trade, technology and defense.

**I**   
During the visit, UK and Korean officials launched talks on an "upgraded" free trade agreement to replace their current deal, which largely replicates arrangements the UK had before it left the European Union.

**J**   
The leaders also signed an agreement pledging closer cooperation on defense and technology, including artificial intelligence. Britain hosted the first international AI Safety Summit this month, and South Korea intends to hold a follow-up event next year.

# World Bank: Difference Between Rich, Poor Countries Is Growing

![example](./2.png 'example')

Half of the world’s 75 poorest countries are getting poorer compared to the richest economies. 

That finding comes from the World Bank. The development agency based in Washington, D.C., recently released 
a report on the least developed nations. It said that the difference in income growth per person in the poorest 
countries and the richest has widened over the past five years. It is the first time the difference has 
increased since the beginning of the 2000s. 

Ayhan Kose is Deputy Chief Economist of the World Bank and one of the writers of the report. He told 
Reuters, “For the first time, we see there is no convergence. They're getting poorer.” 

He said the report writers saw “a very serious structural regression.” Kose said that is why the report 
is bringing attention to it. 

The writers studied the 75 countries that can receive financial aid and zero-interest loans from the World 
Bank’s International Development Association (IDA). The report said the nations risk losing 10 years of 
development without changes in policy and a lot of international aid. 

Kose said growth in many IDA countries had already begun to slow before the COVID-19 pandemic. But it was 
just 3.4 percent in 2020-2024. That is the weakest five years of growth since the early 1990s. 

The report blamed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, climate change, and increases in violence and conflict as 
the main influences on the countries’ development. 

More than half of all IDA countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa, or Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Fourteen 
are in the Asia Pacific area and eight are in Latin America and the Caribbean area. Thirty-one have per person 
incomes of less than $1,315 a year. Those countries include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, and 
Haiti. 

One in three IDA countries is poorer now than they were at the beginning of the pandemic. IDA countries make 
up 92 percent of the world’s people who lack enough affordable, nutritious food. 

Additionally, half of the countries are in debt distress. That means they are either unable to pay their 
debt or are at high risk of failing to make payments. 

These countries have some resources. Many are rich in natural resources and have the possibility of solar 
energy. They also have young populations at a time when populations are aging in developed countries. 
However, private and government creditors have been less willing to loan these countries money. 

U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh discussed the situation recently. He warned that China and 
other emerging official creditors are gaining by reducing loans to low-income countries as the International 
Monetary Fund and development banks are making money available. 

He said that almost 40 countries saw more money leaving the country to pay debt than coming in as new loans 
in 2022. And he said that situation likely increased in 2023. 

Kose called for ambitious policies to increase investment. He urged countries to make policy improvements 
to strengthen their financial systems. He also added that countries should make structural changes to 
improve education and increase income. 

Kose also called for financial support from the world community to lower the risk of limited economic 
growth. He noted that the World Bank hoped rich countries will increase financial support for the IDA 
by December. 

The report added that stronger international efforts on climate change, debt restructuring, and measures 
supporting international trade remained important. 

Indermit Gill is Chief Economist of the World Bank. He noted that China, India, and South Korea had once
been among the world’s poorest countries. He said they were able to deal with poverty and raise living 
standards. Those countries are now among the world’s strongest economies. 

He said, “The world cannot afford to turn its back on IDA countries.”
