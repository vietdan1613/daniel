Local representative Do Thi Lan Anh is among the Top 12 finalists in the Best National Costume sub-contest 
at the Miss Earth 2023 pageant, which is currently underway in Da Lat. 

This comes following Lan Anh putting in an impressive performance whilst wearing her costume created by designer 
Nguyen Tien Truyen which draw inspiration from national heroine Trung Trac. 

The organisers announced the Top 12 of the Best National Costume for continental groups, including Miss Earth 
Vietnam, Miss Earth Philippines, and Miss Earth Myanmar in the Asia and Oceania group. 

The group of Africa included the beauties from Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, whilst three contestants from 
Paraguay, Bolivia, and Venezuela made the group of Americas. 

Miss Earth Bulgaria, Miss Earth Albania, and Miss Earth Germany won the highest score in the group of Europe. 

Moving forward, the winner of this sub-contest will then be announced in the grand final of the Miss Earth 2023 
pageant which is scheduled to take place on December 22 in Ho Chi Minh City. 

Previously, Vietnamese beauty Do Thi Lan Anh was named as the winner of the Best Appearance award on the opening 
day of the Miss Earth pageant. 

These impressive victories will prove to be a great advantage for the Vietnamese representative in the race for 
the Top 20. 

Do Thi Lan Anh, 26, is currently residing in the United States and stands at 1.71 metres tall with body 
measurements of 85-60-95cm. She left her hometown at the age of one for Europe before then moving to the US 
to settle down with her family. 

This marks the second time that Vietnam has played host to this prestigious global pageant, following the 
2010 edition. 

At previous events, Nguyen Phuong Khanh beat 86 other contestants to win Miss Earth 2018, thereby becoming 
the first beauty of her country to take the crown at one of the Big Four international pageants.
