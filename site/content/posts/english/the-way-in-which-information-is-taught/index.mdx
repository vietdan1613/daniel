The way in which information is taught can **vary** greatly across cultures and time-periods. Entering a British primary school classroom from the early 1900s, 
for example, one gains a sense of **austerity**, **discipline** and a **rigid** way of teaching. Desks are **typically** seated apart from one another, with **straight-backed**
wooden chairs that face directly to the teacher and the **chalkboard**. In the present day, British classrooms look very different. Desks are often grouped 
together so that students face each other rather than the teacher, and a large floor area is typically set **aside** for the class to come together for group 
discussion and learning.

Traditionally, it was felt that teachers should be in firm control of the learning process, and that the teacher's task was to prepare and present material 
for students to understand. Within this approach, the relationship students have with their teachers is not considered important , nor is the relationship 
students have with each other in the classroom. A student's participation in class is likely to be minimal, aside from asking questions directed at the teacher, 
or responding to questions that the teacher has directed at the student. This style encourages students to develop respect for positions of power as a source 
of control and discipline. It is frequently described as the 'formal authority' model of teaching.

A less rigid form of teacher-centred education is the '**demonstrator**' model. This maintains the formal authority model's **notion** of the teacher as a 'flashlight' 
who **illuminates** the material for his or her class to learn, but emphasises a more **individualised** approach to form. The demonstrator acts as both a role model 
and a guide, demonstrating skills and processes and then helping students develop and apply these **independently**. Instructors who are drawn to the demonstrator 
style are generally confident that their own way of performing a task represents a good base model, but they are sensitive to differing learning styles and 
expect to provide students with help on an **individual** basis.

Many education researchers argue for student-centred learning instead, and suggest that the learning process is more successful when students are in control. 
Within the student-centred **paradigm**, the 'delegator' style is popular. The delegator teacher maintains general **authority**, but they **delegate** much of the responsibility 
for learning to the class as a way for students to become independent thinkers who take pride in their own work. Students are often encouraged to work on their own or 
in groups, and if the delegator style is implemented successfully they will build not only a working knowledge of course specific topics, but also **serf-discipline** and 
the ability to **co-ordinate** group work and **interpersonal** roles.

Another style that emphasises student-centred education is the 'facilitator' mode of learning. Here, while a set of specific **curriculum** demands are already in place, 
students are encouraged to take the **initiative** for creating ways to meet these learning requirements together. The teacher typically designs activities that encourage 
active learning, group collaboration and problem solving, and students are encouraged to process and apply the course content in creative and original ways. **Whereas** 
the delegator style emphasises content, and the responsibility students can have for generating and directing their own knowledge base, the facilitator style emphasises 
form, and the **fluid** and diverse possibilities that are available in the process of learning. Until the 1960s,formal authority was common in almost all Western schools 
and universities. As a professor would enter a university **lecture theatre**, a student would be expected to **rush up**, take his bag to the desk, and pull out the chair for 
the professor to sit down on . This style has become **outmoded** over time. Now at university, students and professors typically have more relaxed, **collegiate** relationships, 
address each other on a first name basis, and **acknowledge** that students have much to contribute in class. Teacher-centred education has a **lingering appeal** in the form 
of the demonstrator style, however, which remains useful in subjects where skills must be **demonstrated** to an **external** standard and the learning process remains fixed 
in the earlier years of education. A student of mathematics, **sewing** or **metalwork** will likely be familiar with the demonstrator style. At the highest levels of education, 
however, the demonstrator approach must be abandoned in all fields as students are required to **produce** innovative work that makes unique contributions to knowledge. 
**Thesis** and doctoral students lead their own research in **facilitation** with **supervisors**.

The delegator style is valuable when the course is likely to lead students to careers that require group projects. Often, someone who has a high level of expertise in 
a particular field does not make for the best employee because they have not learnt to apply their abilities in a co-ordinated manner. The delegator style **confronts** 
this problem by **recognising** that **interpersonal** communication is not just a means to learning but an important skill set in itself. The **facilitator** model is probably 
the most creative model, and is therefore not suited to subjects where the practical component **necessitates** a careful and highly disciplined manner, such as training 
to be a medical practitioner. It may, however, suit more experimental and **theoretical** fields ranging from English, music and the social sciences,to science and medical 
valuable research that takes place in research labs. In these areas, 'mistakes' in form are important and **aspects** of the learning and development process.

Overall, a dear evolution has taken place in the West from a rigid, **dogmatic** and **teacher-dominated** way of learning, to a flexible, creative and student-centred approach. 
Nevertheless, different subjects, ages and skill levels suit different styles of teaching, and it is unlikely that there will ever be one recommended approach for everyone.
